Version 2.1_20150305:
====================
+ Fix:
  . Did not parsed <?= at global scope.
  . Did not checked the type of the left-hand side of the .= operator, which
    must be a string.
  . Added missing /= operator.
  . Static access to non-static method C::m() is allowed only in the non-static
    context of the class C or its subclass, so that the current $this value is
    set and appropriate. Previous behavior always allowed the expression also
    from the wrong context.
  . NULL value can be assigned to something of type null. Silly, but just for
    consistency; variables and functions of type null are useless anyway because
    they contains or return just one value: NULL.
  . Formal arguments of type string with default value NULL were rendered
    in the documentation as a double-quoted string "NULL" rather than NULL.
  . DocBLock, in-line tag {@link f(arguments)} and {@link C::m(arguments)}: spelling
    of the function and method names are now performed to enforce case-sentiveness;
    sample arguments are reported in the documentation as expected.
  . Detects "use NonQualifiedNonAbsolute;" statement in non namespaced code,
    which is reported as error by PHP with the message: "the use statement with
    non-compound name 'NonQualifiedNonAbsolute' has no effect". Whatever does it
    means. Also suggests to either add a leading \ or remove the useless statement.

+ Implemented PHP language:
  . Parenthesized subexpression dereferencing (EXPR)->... now allowed (PHP 5.6+).
    This allows to write something like (new MyClass())->m().

+ DocBlocks:
  . Links to interface, abstract class and unchecked exceptions are now rendered
    in italic characters to make evident their specific special nature.
  . Requirements (PHP version, modules, packages) moved to the bottom of the
    generated document; descriptive text of the package now appears just at the
    top of the page, which is the first thing one wishes to look at opening the
    page. The ".php" file name extension now removed from the names of the
    required modules.
  . Now recognizes these HTML elements: <u>, <h1>, ..., <h6>.

+ Documentator: after each method, list all the implemented and overridden
  methods.

+ Updates and fixes in modules: gd, standard, zip.

+ Updates and fixes in standard library:
  errors.php (fix: uncaught exception now terminates execution with exit(1)).
  utf8.php (fix: in some cases, u() ignored arguments past the first).
  it\icosaedro\io\InputStream (add method readFully()).
  it\icosaedro\io\ResourceInputStream (now implements SeekableInputStream).
  it\icosaedro\io\StringInputStream (now implements SeekableInputStream).
  it\icosaedro\utils\UString (fix: toUCS2BE() sometimes returned an empty string).
  it\icosaedro\utils\StringBuffer (adds methods length() and setLength()).
  errors.php (PHP core engine errors are thrown as unchecked InternalException;
      see DocBlock of the package for details).

+ New tools of the stdlib:
  bcmath-for-decimal-replacement.php (replacement for the missing BCMATH module).
  bcmath-for-int-replacement.php (replacement for the missing BCMATH module, int only).
  com\tecnick\barcode\Barcode (barcode generation, several specialized classes).
  com\tecnick\barcode2d\Barcode2D (2D barcode generation, several specialized classes).
  it\icosaedro\io\SeekableInputStream (interface to a seekable input stream).
  org/fpdf/FPDF (PDF document generator).
  it\icosaedro\geometry (2D geometry)

Version 2.0_20141127:
====================
+ Fix: require_module crashed if module loading failed.
+ Fix: did not properly shown the name of an undeclared global variable found
  in `global' statement.
+ Fix: did not properly parsed DocBlock's in-line tag in short description.
+ Fix: PHPLint's Documentator reported NULL literal string in double-quote.
+ Added unimplemented keywords to the Scanner, so appropriate error message can
  be shown: callable, insteadof, trait, yield.
+ The PHPLint program now sends its output to the php://output, rather than
  to php://stdout, so the output undergoes to the same processing of "echo".
+ New tools of the stdlib:
  UnimplementedException (unimplemented functions may throw this)
  it\icosaedro\io\ZipFileReader (ZIP file reader)
  it\icosaedro\io\Base64InputStream (Base64 stream decoder)
  it\icosaedro\io\Base64OutputStream (Base64 stream encoder)
  it\icosaedro\io\DeflateOutputStream (DEFLATE stream compressor)
  it\icosaedro\io\DeflateInputStream (DEFLATE stream decompressor)
  it\icosaedro\io\GZIPInputStream (GZIP stream decoder)
  it\icosaedro\io\GZIPOutputStream (GZIP stream encoder)
  it\icosaedro\io\InputStreamAsResource (Converts InputStream into PHP's resource)
  it\icosaedro\io\KeepTailInputStream (Output stream filter that retains a given amount of trailing bytes.)
  it\icosaedro\io\OutputStreamAsResource (Converts OutputStream into PHP's resource)
  it\icosaedro\io\SkipHeadOutputStream (Output filter that skips initial bytes)
  it\icosaedro\io\SkipTailOutputStream (Output filter that skips final bytes)
  it\icosaedro\io\SplitOutputStream (Output stream filter that split)
  it\icosaedro\io\StreamWrapper (PHP's stream wrapper class)
  it\icosaedro\io\UncloseableOutputStream (Stream filter that prevent close)
  it\icosaedro\io\ZLIBCompressInputStream (ZLIB decompressor)
  it\icosaedro\io\ZLIBCompressOutputStream (ZLIB compressor)

+ New hierarchy of specialized IOException-s:
  it\icosaedro\io\FileException (extends IOException for disk file exceptions)
  it\icosaedro\io\FileNotFoundException (extends FileException)
  it\icosaedro\io\FilePermissionException (extends FileException)
  it\icosaedro\io\CorruptedException (extends IOException)
  it\icosaedro\utils\StringBuffer (more efficient using the php://memory stream)

+ Changes to existing classes:
  it\icosaedro\io\FileInputStream: throws more specialized IOException-s as
  listed above: FileNotFoundException and FilePermissionException.
  it\icosaedro\io\StringOutputStream: removed "abstract" attribute to make it
  directly usable. Uses the new StringBuffer that makes it very efficient.
  
+ Updated modules: bz2, standard, streams, zip.

Version 2.0_20140824:
====================
+ Fix: failed parsing statements beginning with the "namespace" operator.
+ Fix: implemented missing --[no-]parse-phpdoc option.
+ Fix: implemented missing --doc-ref-remap option.
+ Fix: did not properly detected class autoloading failure and crashed.
+ Fix: cast(T,V) crashed at runtime displaying invalid cast when V was
  "array[int]" or was "array[string]".
+ Added "mixed" as type recognized by cast(T,V). This allows to scan unknown
  arrays of any type, for example:
		cast("mixed[]", $any)    (returns mixed[])
		cast("array", $any)      (the same using the old array syntax)
		cast("array[]", $any)    (the same using the old array syntax)
  and so on.
+ Fix: File::getParentFile() failed on Unix.
+ Fix: crashed in Documentator searching global variable.
+ Fix: Documentator did not escaped HTML special chars in literal strings.
+ Fix: Linux shell scripts 'php' and 'phpl' now support spaces in arguments.
+ Fix: phplint.tcl did not updated the dir. of php.ini as the PHPLint package
  changes; now the configuration panel asks for the "PHPLint directory" rather
  than the "php.ini directory".
+ Updated modules: tokenizer.

Version 2.0_20140331:
====================
Completely rewritten program, now in PHP >= 5.3 itself. Please, read the
README.txt file for installation and usage.

+ Abstract class may re-define inherited abstract method (PHP bug #43200).
+ Private [non-]static method may re-define inherited private [non-]static
  method (PHP bug 61761).
+ A class can now implement the same method inherited from different interfaces,
  but the signature must be equal (PHP >= 5.3.9). Under PHPLint, this means the
  2 inherited methods must have the exact same prototype (same return type,
  arguments types, errors and exceptions).
+ Redundant implemented interfaces is detected and forbidden. PHP allows to
  list "... implements BaseInterface, ExtendedInterface" in that order, but
  gives a fatal error if the order is reversed. PHPLint is more conservative
  and forbids any redundancy (in the example, only ExtendedInterface should be
  listed because already includes BaseInterface).
+ Support array short syntax "[E1,E2,E3]".
+ Added the "triggers" meta-code (see example below; also see the @triggers
  DocBlock line-tag below).
+ int can be compared with float, no need to cast int to float.

+ DocBlock:
  . DocBlocks referring to the current file as a whole MUST have the @package
    line tag.
  . Missing @param for formal arguments are not signaled as error anymore.
    The type of the argument is can be guessed from the default value (if
	available) or from the PHPLint meta-code /*.T.*/. Finally, and only if the
	type cannot be determine, an error is reported.
  . Missing @return is not signaled as error anymore. The returned type can be
    read from the PHPLint meta-code (if available) or from the first "return"
	statement, or "void" if not "return" statement is found. Using the value
	returned when still not determined (example: recursive call) is signaled
	as error; in this case, an explicit declaration is required.
  . In-line tags {@xxx} are now resolved immediately, so the same name
    resolution that applies to PHP items holds; in particular, forward
	references to source code that follows cannot be made.
  . Added the "@triggers ERROR DESCR" line tag, where ERROR is any PHP error
    label (E_NOTICE, E_WARNING, etc.).
  . Removed the "@global TYPE $VAR" line-tag. Global variable must be always
    assigned in global scope, and there can be documented as usual.
  . "@var TYPE DESCR" is now "@var TYPE" (removed DESCR part; short and long
    descriptions already do the job).
  . Allows &nbsp; &lt; &gt; $le; and &ge; escape codes.

  . In-line tags:
    . Are now resolved only if the documentation gets generated. This way,
      {@link ITEM} any item, for example the DocBlock of a class may refer
      a method which is declare below. This behavior differs from types in
      line-tags, that are resolved *while* parsing the file and then cannot
      make reference to items that are still undefined at the time that line
      gets parsed. In-line tags have offer more freedom and flexibility, for
      example while documenting a class:
      
      /**
       * My class. So, so, and so. Try the beautiful
       * method {@link self::hello()} that prints hello.
       */
      class MyClass {
          function hello(){ echo "Hello!"; }
      }

    . "self" and "parent" can be used.
    . Absolute file paths /usr/www or C:/User are not allowed anymore; only
      relative file paths starting with ./xxx and ../xxx are.
    . Added https:// protocol to {@link https://xxx}.
    
+ Old style annotations blocks /*. DOC xxxx .*/ support removed and signaled
  as error by the scanner. Use DocBlock or PHPLint meta-code instead.

+ Undefined constants, variables, functions, classes, and class members are
  always signaled as error (previously only the first occurrence was signaled
  and further messages about the same item were avoided, so the programmer
  had to fix an error at a time).

+ Parsing of the signature of function and method:
  . Always tries to guess the return type from the return statement, no more
    log messages if the declaration is missing. Explicit return type must be
    indicated in DocBlock or meta-code only if the function/method is called
    before the parsing of the first "return" be completed, otherwise an error
    is reported.
  . Formal arguments for which a type cannot be determined are signaled and
    their type is set to "unknown" (not mixed as before). So, for example:

          /**
           * @param int $a
           */
          function f($a, $b, $c = 0){...}

    an error is signaled only for $b whose type cannot be determined, while
    $a and $c are obviously int.
    Constructors and destructors methods always return "void".
  . New meta-code keyword "triggers" added to support declaration of triggered
    errors in prototypes, functions and methods and abstract methods. Example:

        interface MyIF {
            function m() /*. triggers E_WARNING throws Exception .*/ ;
        }

        /*. forward function f() triggers E_USER_ERROR; .*/

  . Un-handled errors and un-caught exceptions must always explicitly declared
    in DocBLock and/or meta-code. This example shows both the usages for
    brevity, but you should choose one in your code:

          /**
           * @triggers E_NOTICE  A bit of problems.
           * @triggers E_WARNING Something went wrong.
           * @throws   Exception Something else went wrong.
           */
          function f() /*. triggers E_NOTICE, E_WARNING  throws Exception .*/
          {...}

+ Support for the new ::class virtual constant: ClassName::class, self::class,
  parent::class (PHP 5).

+ The type T in the cast(T,V) magic function is not limited to a literal string
  or named constant, but it may be any static expression of type string.
  Example:  $other2 = cast(self::class, $other);

+ Command line interface:
  . Removed --debug option (reason: unimplemented).
  . Removed --modules-path (reason: require_once always specifies abs. dir.)
  . Removed --packages-path DIRS command line option (reason: packages must be
    included either with require_once and an absolute path, or through the
    autoloader).
  . Added option --[no-]print-column-number, so that entries of the report
    may have form "FILE:LINE:COL: SEVERITY: DESCRIPTION" allowing external
    tools to display the exact point of the error.
  . The diagnostic messages reported may span over several lines (see reference
    manual, chapter "Usage" for details about the format of the report).

+ GUI tool phplint.tct:
  . "phplint.tk" changed name into "phplint.tcl".
  . Now calls the PHP CLI interpreter and then runs PHPLint.php.
  . Can displays file paths relative to the source being parsed (use the
    "relative" option).

+ utils/GenerateDoc.php helps to generate the documentation from a directory of
  source files. See the README.txt file for more details.

+ PHPLint standard library:
  . it\icosaedro\regex\Pattern: fixed bug that causes RuntimeException.
  . New classes of the stdlib:
    it\icosaedro\lint\PHPLint.php (PHPLint program)
    it\icosaedro\io\File (filename abstraction)
    it\icosaedro\io\ResourceInputStream (turns resource into InputStream)
    it\icosaedro\io\ResourceOutputStream (turns resource into OutputStream)
    it\icosaedro\io\LineInputWrapper (read line-by-line from InputStream)
    it\icosaedro\utils\SimpleDiff (determines text file differences)
    it\icosaedro\utils\StringBuffer (dynamic buffer of bytes)
+ PHP modules files modules/*.php:
  . Module files now have their *.php extension, although being not real PHP
    programs (editors with syntax highlight signal syntax errors just
    for this reason, but these errors can be safely ignored because modules
    are never actually executed by the PHP interpreter). Nothing changes
    for the require_module statement, where the name of the module without
    extension must be indicated. So, "standard.php" must be included with
    "/*. require_module 'standard'; .*/" as usual.
  . Updated: json, standard, spl (removed definition of class SimpleXMLIterator
    because relies on the simplexml module which is deprecated by PHPLint),
    zip, zlib.


Version 1.1-201xxxxx:
====================
+ Harald Lapp patch to "compile" script.


Version 1.1-20130803:
====================
+ Updated PHP modules: curl, mysqli, session, spl, standard.

Version 1.1-20120402:
====================
+ FIX: failed to detect positive signed literal constants `const X=+123;' in
  static expressions generating an infinite loop.
+ FIX: in concrete classes, failed to check if all the methods inherited from
  all the interfaces at any deep level were actually implemented.
+ FIX: flow analysis: failed to recognize actual execution path in nested
  do/while loops.
+ FIX: on autoloading, did not properly restored the context of the
  thrown exceptions, possibly forgetting already detected exceptions.
+ Short tag <?= deprecation reverted in PHP>=5.4.0 so it does not generate
  Warning under PHPLint anymore.
+ Updated PHP modules: iconv, pcre, standard.
+ Added modules: fileinfo, intl, phar.
+ Removed modules: mime_magic (replaced by fileinfo).
+ Update PHPLint Standard Libraries:
  it\icosaedro\utils\UString (trimming, case-insensitive comparisons, case
  conversion);
+ Added libraries:
  utf8 (convenience function for UTF-8 encoded source files);
  it\icosaedro\io\InputStream (interface to a generic source of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\OutputStream (interface to a generic drain of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\BufferInputStream (string of bytes as source of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\BufferOutputStream (string of bytes as drain of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\FileInputStream (file as source of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\FileOutputStream (file as drain of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\FileName (Unicode file name manipulation);
  it\icosaedro\regex\Pattern (parses strings with regular expressions);
  it\icosaedro\regex\UPattern (parses Unicode strings with regular expressions);
  it\icosaedro\utils\BitSet (set of non-negative numbers);
  it\icosaedro\utils\Histogram (generates an histogram);
  it\icosaedro\utils\UTF8 (handling of UTF-8 encoded strings);
  net\sourceforge\phpmailer\PHPMailer (sends e-mail; GNU LGPL license);
  net\sourceforge\phpmailer\SMTP (supports SMTP protocol; GNU LGPL license);

Version 1.1-20120202:
====================
+ FIX: class autoloading triggered inside function failed to restore the stack
  of the local variables and the list of the thrown exceptions and DocBlock
  parsing.
+ FIX: when errors-to-exceptions mapping enabled, complained missing thrown
  exception declaration in module's functions triggering errors.
+ FIX: bare "array" and "array[]" are now assumed "array[]mixed" as it should
  be, and not "array[]UNKNOWN". This fixes several errors that where signaled
  in assignment and return from function.
+ FIX: arrays of the same type can be added together. Note for non-PHP
  programmers: array("a","b") + array("c") gives array("a","b") and NOT
  array("a","b","c") is you may think so carefully read the PHP manual for
  more details.
+ FIX: statements can now start with the silencer operator "@", so
        @unlink($tmp_file);
  is valid. Restrictions: the silencer operator is not allowed for require*,
  include* and define* statements; the silencer operator cannot be used if
  errors-to-exceptions mapping is enabled, in which case you may use
        try { unlink($tmp_file); } catch(ErrorException $e){...}
+ Supports new syntax "T[]", so that "string[int]" is equivalent to
  "array[int]string" and "float[string][int]" is equivalent to
  "array[string][int]float". This new syntax is supported in any context,
  including PHPLint meta-code, DocBlocks and type descriptor of the cast()
  magic function. This new syntax is preferred under PHPLint over the old form
  "array[]T" because it is shorter and forces to specify the index and the type
  of the elements, avoiding "array[]" or even worse "array". The old form can
  still be useful for PHP type-hinting, where PHP code can be mixed with
  PHPLint meta-code like in this example: function f(array /*. [int]string .*/
  $names){...}.
+ The require_once statement now requires an absolute path, otherwise an error
  is raised. The require, include and include_once now require an absolute
  path, otherwise a warning is raised. Under PHP5, you may use __DIR__ to
  retrieve the directory of the current script.
+ Class name \Exception is now reserved as root of the exceptions tree,
  whickever the module or package it may be declared in.
+ Uppercase/lowercase misspelled keywords, namespaces, contants, functions,
  classes and methods are signaled as errors, not notices. Misspelled
  namespaces and class names prevent class autoloading from working properly on
  case-sensitive file systems (Unix, Linux).
+ Generated documents: also specify which methods any given method implements
  or overrides.
+ Command line options:
    + Add --[no-]fails-on-warning (exit status 1 also on warnings).
    + Add --[no]overall (no final line summarizing total err+warn).
    + Changed behavior of the --[no-]recursive option (see manual for more).
+ On Windows, UNC file names now supported and recognized as absolute paths.
+ Documentator:
  + FIX: exit status did not accounted for errors detected generating docs
    with the --doc option.
  + FIX: in named anchors of the generated URLs, replace \ by / in namespace,
    so internal links become "YourClass.html#na/me/spa/ce::method()"
    (newer releases of FF complained about backslashes).
  + FIX: did not resolved inline tags in "throws" section.
  + DocBlocks:
    + FIX: properly renders line leading spaces (see <pre>) and empty lines.
    + Adds support for array type syntax T[][].
    + Adds non-standard new inline tag {@img URL} to add image.
    + Adds non-standard entities <sup> <sub> <blockquote> <center>.
    + Adds support for Unicode escape sequences &#DDD; and &#xHHH; so arbitrary
      codepoints can be entered.
+ Generated documentation about modules and PHPLint standard library now come
  along the distributed package.
+ phplint.tk:
  + FIX: handles properly white spaces in file names.
  + HTML links to the modules now references the local documents, not the
    www.icosaedro.it WEB site.
+ Updated modules: dom, exif, imap, json, mysqli, pgsql, simplexml, spl,
  standard, streams, zlib.
+ PHPLint Standard Library:
  + cast.php: parsed type descriptors in cast(T,...) are compiled and cached
    for better runtime performances.
  + Adds namespace it\icosaedro\containes (HashSet, HasMap, Arrays).
  + Adds namespace it\icosaedro\sql with support for MySQL and PostgreSQL.
  + Adds several utilities to the it\icosaedro\utils namespace (Bytes, Date,
    Statistics1D, Timer, UString).

Version 1.0-20110223:
====================
+ FIX: magic constants were reported as defined in the first package parsed,
  now are in the 'standard' core module.

Version 1.0-20110206:
====================
ATTENTION! Updated M2 Development System 1.5_20110205 is required in order to
succesfully compile this release of PHPLint from the M2 sources.
+ FIX: crash parsing DocBlock after import of module or library, mostly due
  to a bug in the "buffer" module of M2. The new, fixed, M2 development
  system is now required.
+ FIX: variables are definitely assigned only after the assignment, so that
  things like this one "$x=$x;" gives error if $x isn't already assigned.
+ The magic constants __DIR__, __CLASS__, __FILE__, __FUNCTION__, __LINE__,
  __METHOD__, __NAMESPACE__ are now defined built-in and do not require to
  include the standard module anymore. This is expecially useful for __DIR__
  to build absolute library paths with require_once __DIR_ . "/mypkg.php"
  even before the inclusion of the standard module itself.
+ Add special constants STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR available in PHP CLI that
  cannot be defined in regular PHP code because their type is "resource"
  and not scalar.
+ 'autoload' pragma now allows to specify the directory of the classes as a
  path relative to the autoload.php package, so that a bare '.' usually does
  the right job provided that the autoload.php package be located in the
  root directory of the classes tree.
+ Add modules: sqlite3 (Joan Llosas).
+ Updated modules: curl.

Version 1.0-20101024:
====================
+ FIX: support "static::..." as a statement outside expression (Jirka Grunt).
+ FIX: cast("SOMECLASS", $obj) with $obj bare object is allowed and,
  at runtime, $obj must be instace of SOMECLASS (Jirka Grunt).
+ FIX: cast("SOMECLASS", $obj) is allowed if $obj evaluates to null (Jirka
  Grunt).
+ FIX: meta-code keyword "missing_break" must be followed by meta-code
  semicolon, so /*. missing_break ; .*/ is the correct syntax (Petr Kostka).
+ FIX: in the autoload pragma added the 'schema1' parameter according to the
  reference manual. ATTENTION! your custom __autoload() function must now add
  this parameter as well.
+ Fixed and updated modules: dom (Dominic Sayers), spl (Jirka Grunt).

Version 1.0-20100808:
====================
+ FIX: "object" is not a valid type-hint for formal arguments in PHP.
+ FIX: class prototype now supports "implements" (Jirka Grunt).
+ FIX: add __callStatic() magic method (Jirka Grunt).
+ FIX: support for the static late binding operator (Jirka Grunt).
+ FIX: the comma before "args" must be inside meta-code, not PHP code.
+ In namespaced classes, warns about methods that have the same name of the
  class and suggests to call them `__construct' (PHP >= 5.3.3 restriction).
+ Add magic function cast() that mostly replaces the formal typecast
  operators. Now under PHP 5 formal typecast /*.(T).*/ allowed only if
  applied to empty array() and NULL in non-static expressions.
+ Add pragma "error_throws_exception" that maps errors into exceptions.
+ Adds the "PHPLint standard library" under the stdlib directory, that
  includes:
  + runtime magic function cast() in cast.php package;
  + error mapping into ErrorException in errors.php package;
  + classes autoloading function in autoload.php package.
+ DocBlock:
  + Leading asterisk in line now no more mandatory and, if present,
    it is simply skipped.
  + Unused @param(s) are reported.
  + Parse the WORD syntactic element also if in the next line.
+ phphlint.tk:
  + "Monitors" the target source, displaying an updated report whenever the
    file changes.
  + Add "Is module" checkbox that allows to parse modules too.
  + Add error color markers bar bar that marks where errors are located.
+ Fixed and updated modules: curl, dom (Dominic Sayers), fdf, filter, ftp, gd,
  json, hash, imap, ldap, mysql, nsapi, pcntl, pcre, pgsql, simplexml, sockets,
  spl (Jirka Grunt, U.S.), sqlite, standard (Jirka Grunt, Dominic Sayers),
  standard_reflection, streams, sysmsg, syssem, sysshm, tidy, xml, xmlreader,
  xmlrpc, xmlwriter, zip, zlib.

Version 0.9-20090802:
====================
Fixed bugs:
+ Namespace resolution: `use' declarations are applied to bare identifiers only
  if are classes; bare identifiers of constants and functions are not resolved
  with `use'.
+ $obj[INDEX] on object implementing ArrayAccess: search offsetGet() method
  also between extended and implemented classes.
+ foreach($obj ...) on object implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate:
  search magic methods also between extended and implemented classes.
+ Check forbidden DocBlock line tags in class constant, property, method.
+ Implementation of concrete and abstract classes declared forward: the forward
  declaration and the actual declaration must have the same attributes private,
  abstract, final and unchecked; moreover, if the forward declaration extends a
  class, then the actual declaration must extend the same exact class too.
+ Attributes of classes must match their forward declaration.
+ The `echo' statement, the `print' statement, the `.=' assignment operator
  and the `.' operator now accept objects that implement __toString().
+ The `print' statement accepts any simple type, not only strings.
+ PHP 4, DocBlock: {@link} can make forward references because these are
  resolved only at the end of the package. Instead, in PHP 5 still reference
  must be resolvable in place because there are the namespace/ operator and the
  `use' declarations to be applied.
+ PHP 4: modules mysql, mysqli and tidy corrected for PHP 4.
+ DocBlocks:
  + In <pre> block, retains leading spaces in lines.
  + Empty lines are properly rendered as paragraph separators.
PHPLint specific features:
+ Checked exceptions MUST be declared either in the `throws' PHPLint meta-code
  or in the `@throws' line tag DocBlock. Actual functions and actual methods
  that implement a prototype must be declare a compatible set of thrown checked
  exceptions.
+ Methods that implements abstract methods or that override inherited methods
  must declare a compatible set of thrown exceptions. Uncought checked
  exceptions in global scope are signaled with a Warning. Uncought checked
  exceptions in function or method must be declared thrown.
+ New meta-code attribute `unchecked' marks exceptions that are unchecked:
  /*. unchecked .*/ class MyException extends Exception {}
  Unchecked exceptions are just like any other exception, but catching them is
  not mandatory. Uncought unchecked exceptions are not signaled anymore.
  Exceptions extending unchecked exceptions must be unchecked.
  Classes `Exception' and `ErrorExceptions' are checked exceptions.
  Exceptions declared in the SPL module are all unchecked.
+ Documentator: for functions and methods, prints a short line that lists all
  the checked exceptions thrown, and a detailed list with all the checked and
  unchecked exceptions for which a description is available.
+ Variables used to catch exceptions as $e in catch(SomeException $e) changes
  their type from a catch() branch to the other, so them are handled in a
  special way: 1. cannot be already in use entering the catch() branch and 2.
  are deleted exiting from the catch() branch so that can be re-used. Flaw: if
  try/catch statements appear in global scope the generated document contains
  some private variables named $catch#1, $catch#2, etc. as an artifact.
+ Updated modules: dom, mysql, mysqli, spl, standard_reflection, tidy.

Version 0.9-20090714:
====================
Fixed bugs:
+ Fixed bug in DocBlock: line tags are now allowed also in DESCR field.
+ Fixed bug in error messages reporting non-ASCII characters (actually a bug
  in the m2runtime.StringToLiteral function corrected in the new release of
  the M2 development system).
PHP syntax:
+ Namespaces (PHP 5.3):
  + Add "namespace" statement.
  + Add "namespace" operator.
  + Add "use" statement.
  + Add "const" statement.
  + Add support for autoloading of classes with __autoload().
  + Support for namespaces in DocBlock.
+ Short tags <? and <?= are now deprecated, use <?php instead.
+ Double-quoted string: added new escape sequences \v \f.
+ Now-doc with double-quoted label and here-doc now supported (PHP 5.3).
+ Parse (but ignores) declare(encoding='xxx').
PHPLint specific features:
+ Packages are now classified as: modules, libraries and programs (see the
  reference manual for details).
+ Class autoloading with __autoload() and the /*.pragma 'autoload'.*/ PHPLint
  meta-code (see the reference manual for details).
+ Detects unsupported BOM leading bytes in source files. ASCII, ISO-8859 and
  UTF-8 without BOM are the only allowed encodings for PHP sources.
+ Detects duplicated labels in `case' branches.
+ Magic constants are resolved into dynamically determinated values: __DIR__,
  __FILE__, __LINE__, __NAMESPACE__, __FUNCTION__, __CLASS__, __METHOD__.
  Expressions whose value can be determinated statically are then allowed also
  in statements as in
      require_once __DIR__."/autoload.php";
  which can be useful for CLI scripts where the CWD is set to the user's CWD.
+ For properties whose type does not allow the NULL value (that is boolean,
  int and float) the initial value must be specified otherwise PHP would
  initialize them to the invalid value NULL. Then, for example:
  private $n = 0;
  private /*. string .*/ $s;
+ For static local variables whose type does not allow the NULL value (that
  is boolean, int and float) the initial value must be specified otherwise PHP
  would initialize them to the invalid value NULL. Then, for example:
  static $count = 0;
  static /*. string .*/ $prefix;
+ Concrete classes that implement Traversable must also implement either
  Iterator or IteratorAggregate, not both (Jirka Grunt).
+ Added new attribute `return' for arguments of function that return a value by
  reference, in addition to the arguments by value and arguments by reference
  that already exists in PHP.
+ $obj[INDEX] for $obj implementing ArrayAccess is allowed, with INDEX of any
  type (the implemented methods should take care to perform any required
  check). The resulting value is the type returned by offsetGet(); since this
  method return mixed in its definition, only string, array, resource and
  objects are allowed as overriding return types. Then bool, int and float
  still have to be returned boxed inside a `mixed'. (Jirka Grunt)
+ foreach($obj as $k => $v): if $obj implements Iterator or IteratorAggregate,
  the type of $k is the return type of the implemented Iterator::key() method
  and the type of $v is the return type of the implemented Iterator::current()
  method; since key() and current() both returns mixed in their definition,
  only string, array, resource and objects are allowed as overriding return
  types. Then bool, int and float still have to be returned boxed inside a
  `mixed'.
+ Flow analysis: handles special cases if(EXPR), while(EXPR), do...while(EXPR)
  whenever EXPR can be statically evaluated to TRUE or FALSE.
+ Definitely assigned variables detection. This feature is under
  development and it is still incomplete: it assumes the variables
  conditionally assigned in expressions as definitely assigned, which is not
  the case as in if(true or ($i = 3) > 0) echo $i; where $i is never assigned.
+ Updated modules: cpdf, dom, gmp, hash, json, ldap, libxml, mysql, mysqli,
  ncurses, oci, openssl, pcntl, pcre, pdo, regex, sockets, spl (Jirka Grunt),
  standard, sysvmsg, tidy, xml, xmlreader.
+ phplint.tk: fixed editor setting.

Version 0.8-20090517:
====================
+ Perform static flow analysis and detect unreachable code and missing return
  statements.
+ In `switch' statement: `case' branches and `default' branch now allowed
  in any order (previously `default' had to be the last).
+ Compound statement {...} now allowed.
+ phpDocumentator DocBlock:
  + Fixed bug in list rendering.
  + Added inline tag {@link}.
  + Added <kbd> speudo-HTML entity.
  + Short description now allows speudo-HTML entities and inline tags.

  (PHP restriction).
+ Bug fix: detects circular references in class declarations.
+ Detects redundant class extension and implementation of classes that are
  already in the inheritance tree of the class or interface being declared.
+ Prototypes: `extends' for concrete and abstract classes now supported
  (`implements' still is not) (Jirka Grunt).
+ Prototypes: interface prototypes now supported (but `extends' still
  unimplemented) (Jirka Grunt).

  (Jirka Grunt).
+ Relaxed signature compatibility rule: sub-classes allowed.
+ Missing ?> at the end of the file now allowed (Jirka Grunt).
+ Removed the dummy type `number' because it is not a proper PHP type; use
  `float' instead.
+ Exceptions:
  + Added meta-code 'throws' declaration for functions, methods and protos.
  + Checks exceptions inherited from overridden and implemented methods.
  + Checks branches in try...catch statement.
+ In DocBlock: lines missing the leading `*' are ignored, but following lines
  are handled correctly (fix).
+ Standard module: changed `number' with `float'.
+ Modules mysqli, readline, session, standard: calbacks are now `mixed'
  to support for both functions and methods (Jirka Grunt).
+ Updated modules: standard_reflection, spl.

Version 0.8-20080621:

+ DocBlocks:
    + Complete support for HTML entities and check for proper usage.
    + Added support for @global.
    + The syntax of the following line tags modified to better match

Version 0.7-20070521:
====================
+ Abstract methods cannot be static.
+ define(..., VALUE): "NULL" is now allowed as VALUE.

  parent constructor/destructor.
+ Checks signature of special methods __destruct, __clone, __set_static,
  __sleep, __wakeup, __toString, __set, __get, __isset, __unset.
