TODO LIST:
- Parsing of "${i}".
- Support for tags: <script, <%, <%=.
- Option for warning on control characters in literal strings, except
  LF, CR, HT.
- Missing modules: sybase_ct.

- DocBlocks:
	- Implement missing line tags: @ignore, @internal, ...
	- Implement missing inline tags.
	- Dotted list automatic detection.
	- Ordered list automatic detection.

- Dereferencing constant by object $obj::CONST is allowed since PHP 5.2.4.

- Static method call with arrow CLASSNAME->staticMetod() allowed since PHP
5.2.4. Is this the reason why in PHP static methods are allowed in interfaces?
Does PHPLint really need to support all this?

- Interface prototypes: implement `extends'.

- Class and interface prototypes: implement constants with type, but without
value (only partially implemented as the type cannot be indicated).

- goto

IDEAS:

- C++ templates (aka Java generics).

- Detect source code encoding and report along the generated documentation.
Warn when packages with different encoding are mixed together. Also
detect initial BOM in text files. Is define(encoding='UTF-8') useful to this?
PROBLEM: strings still allows to mix binary data that do not belong to any
character encoding: "\x00\x01\x03".
Since PHP 5.3.0 the declare(encoding='xxx') is available.
