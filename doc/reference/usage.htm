<h2 id="toc">Usage</h2>

<p>
The distributed package comes with a script file in the root directory of
the distributes package named
<code>phpl</code> (Unix, Linux) or <code>phpl.bat</code> (Windows) that
starts the PHPLint validator. The <code>README.txt</code> file explains
how to configure the PHP interpreter and how to start the program.
</p>


<h3>Syntax of the command line</h3>
</a>

<p>
The general syntax of the command is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<code>phpl [ option | file ] ...</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
where the arguments are any combination of files and options. Options
start with an hyphen "-", so that file names cannot start with this
character. All the arguments are parsed from left to right, and the files are
parsed in the order, so that every option affects only the files to its right.
</p>

<p>
Normally only one source file at a time should be parsed, leaving to PHPLint
to follow recursively other required packages included with
<code>require_once</code>.
</p>

<p>
Several files can also be provided as well, and they are parsed in the
order. But be careful because PHPLint collects items defined in each source
parsed, so it cannot detect if some of these files omits to include any of
the sources already scanned. It is ok to scan several, unrelated, files at once
in order to detect possible collisions among global items: this test can
be useful if you plan, later, to include all these files in some application.
</p>

<p>
Many options are flags and have the form <code>--xxxx</code> to enable,
and the corresponding <code>--no-xxxx</code> to disable a feature.
</p>


<h3>Parsing options</h3>
</a>

<dl>

<dt><code>--version</code></dt>
<dd>Print version and copyright notice of the program.</dd>

<dt><code>--help</code></dt>
<dd>Print a brief description of the command and of the options.</dd>

<dt>
<code>--php-version 4</code><br>
<code>--php-version 5</code> (default)</dt>
<dd>
The PHP version, 4 or 5. The differences among PHP 4 and 5 are mostly
limited to the OOP, but there are also some differences in the extension
modules that are available with a version of the language and not in
the other. The source is parsed according to the version specified, and
this version is also reported in the documentation so generated.
</dd>

<dt><code>--is-module</code><br>
<code>--no-is-module</code> (default)</dt>
<dd>
This flag should never be used when checking regular user's packages; it was
introduced just as a trick to generate the documentation about extension
modules avoiding several errors from being displayed.
Enabling this flag, the parsed files are considered as files of prototypes
describing extension modules of the PHP language and then:
<ul>
<li>
Missing <code>return&nbsp;</code><i>EXPR</i><code>;</code> statements are not
signaled as error because prototypes are not actual code to be executed.
</li>
<li>
The <code>trigger_error();</code> statement may raise error codes that are
otherwise forbidden in regular user's packages, as <code>E_DEPRECATED</code>.
</li>
</ul>
This flag is effective until disabled by <code>--no-is-module</code>, so
several modules can be parsed at once with the flag enabled.
</dd>


<dt>
<code>--recursive</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-recursive</code></dt>
<dd>Parse recursively every <code>require_once</code> statement that appears at
scope level zero. If disabled, does not follows require_once statements that
may appear in the sorce files given from command line; autoloading is still
available and files autoloaded may, in turn, use the require_once statement.
THis option serves only for obvious security reasons just to implement the
PHPLint-on-line mask available in the www.icosaedro.it WEB site, and should not
be used elsewhere.
<dd>

<dt>
<code>--parse-phpdoc</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-parse-phpdoc</code></dt>
<dd>
With this option enabled, PHPLint will parse DocBlocks
comments and will collect short/long descriptions, variables, parameters, etc.
herein declared. Sources not intended to be phpDocumentor-compliant often uses
<code>/******/</code> or alike as visual markers, but these markers are not
valid DocBlocks and an error is raised: in this case it is required to disable
DocBlock parsing.
</dd>

</dl>


<h3>Error detection</h3>
</a>

<dl>

<dt>
<code>--ctrl-check</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-ctrl-check</code></dt>
<dd>
Reports control characters found in strings.
</dd>

<dt>
<code>--ascii-ext-check</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-ascii-ext-check</code></dt>
<dd>
Reports "extended ASCII" characters (ISO-xxx, UTF-8, etc.) found in the
source, either in the literal strings and in IDs. The bare HTML code
outside the PHP code is not checked.
</dd>

<dt>
<code>--print-notices</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-print-notices</code><br>
<code>--print-warnings</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-print-warnings</code><br>
<code>--print-errors</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-print-errors</code></dt>
<dd>
Print error/warning/notice messages.
<i>Errors</i> are problems that might involve safety or security issues,
or that may prevent the program from running at all.  <i>Notices</i>
have mostly informational purpose, but are still useful to "fine tuning"
the source (unused variables, misspelled case-insensitive names, etc.).
<i>Warnings</i> are all the other cases that PHPLint was not able to resolve
neither as error nor as notice, anyhow human attention is required.
</dd>

</dl>


<h3>Format of the report</h3>
</a>

<p>
The report generated on standard output is a sequence of lines having this
general structure:
</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
<i>file_name</i>:<i>line_no</i>:<i>col_no</i>: <i>severity</i>: <i>description</i>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
where
</p>

<blockquote>

	<p>
	<code><i>file_name</i></code> is the absolute path of the file the
	message is referring to or the relative path depending on the
	current options chosen. File names are locale-encoded.
	Set to <code>?</code> if the message is not related to a specific source
	file.
	</p>

	<p>
	<code><i>line_no</i></code> is the line number, the first line of the
	source being the number 1. Set to <code>?</code> if the message is
	not related to a specific line of the source file, or it is not
	related to any source file at all.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<code><i>col_no</i></code> is the column number on the line, being
	the first character of the line the no.1. Set to <code>?</code> if
	the message is not related to a specific position on the line, or
	it is not related to a specific line, or it is not related to any
	source file at all.
	</p>

	<p>
	<code><i>severity</i></code> can be <code>ERROR</code>,
	<code>ERROR</code>, <code>Warning</code> or <code>notice</code>.
	Errors are pathological issues detected by PHPLint that can affect
	the safety, or the security or the general formal consistency of
	the program and that should be fixed. Warnings messages about
	potential issues, but PHPLint failed to establish if are actual
	errors or not, but attention from the programmer is required
	anyway. Notices are informative messages that can be safely ignored.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<code><i>description</i></code> is the textual description of
	the errors found. It may extends over several lines, every
	continuation line starting with a tabulator character which is not
	part of the message itself.
	Basically, the diagnostic messages are plain ASCII, but may also contain
	parts from the source being parsed that are in an unspecified, arbitrary
	character encoding.
	</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Lines are terminated by the platform-depended "new line" sequence encoded
	by the PHP_EOL constant, that is <code>"\n"</code> on Unix/Linux and
	<code>"\r\n"</code> on Windows.
</p>

<p>
A final line summarizes the total number of errors and warnings found (see also the <code>--overall</code> option):
</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
Overall test results: <i>number</i> errors, <i>number</i> warnings.
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
The format described here is suitable to be post-processed by other programs.
Several options can modify the format of the report, mostly to render it
more readable:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>
<code>--print-source</code><br>
<code>--no-print-source</code> (default)</dt>
<dd>Print the source, line by line, every line with its number. Source and
diagnostic messages are so mixed in a human-readable form.</dd>

<dt>
<code>--print-line-numbers</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-print-line-numbers</code>
</dt>
<dd>
Enable/disable the line numbers printed along the source, when
<code>--print-source</code> is enables. Disabling line numbers the shorter
report so generated is suitable to be compared with an old one to see the
differences and to monitor the improvements of the source, avoiding to confuse
the <code>diff</code> program even if the source gets slightly changed adding
or removing lines.
</dd>

<dt>
<code>--print-file-name</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-print-file-name</code></dt>
<dd>
Every error message marks the message with the name of the file, the line
number and the column number. The resulting report file might become very
long and difficult to read, especially if absolute file names are printed.
When this option gets disabled the file name gets printed only if the
message involves errors found in imported packages and not in the package
specified in the command line.
</dd>

<dt>
<code>--print-column-number</code><br>
<code>--no-print-column-number</code> (default)</dt>
<dd>
If to print also the column number next to the file name and the line number.
The first character in a source line is the column number 1.
Off by default to improve human readability. External tools may instead
enable this option to recover the exact position of the error in the source
(see also the <code>--tab-size</code> option).
</dd>

<dt>
<code>--print-path absolute</code> (default)<br>
<code>--print-path relative</code><br>
<code>--print-path shortest</code>
</dt>
<dd>
By default file names are always displayed as absolute paths, so to simplify
the work of automated programs to which the report has to be submitted
for further processing.
The report can be made more human readable enabling the displaying of
paths relative to the current working directory (the directory from
which PHPLint was started). The option <code>shortest</code> automatically
choose the shortest representation between the absolute and the relative
path.
</dd>

<dt>
<code>--report-unused</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-report-unused</code></dt>
<dd>Report unused items. Items collected from here on are reported
in a notice message if not used. This include both global entities
(constants, global variables, functions, classes, class constants,
properties and methods) and local variables inside functions and methods.
</dd>

<dt>
<code>--print-context</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-print-context</code></dt>
<dd>
When an error is detected, the line of the source involved is printed
along the error message. The exact point of the line where the error
was detected is visually marked with "<code>\_HERE</code>".
</dd>

<dt>
<code>--tab-size N</code> (default: 8)</dt>
<dd>Set the size of the tabulation character (ASCII HT) typically used
to indent the code. Every error message raised by PHPLint is preceded
by the file name, the line number and column number. The tabulation size
is required to exactly calculate the column where the problem was detected.
External tools may want to set 1 here so that the column number (see option
<code>--print-column-number</code>) will be the byte offset + 1 on the
source line.
</dd>

<dt>
<code>--overall</code> (default)<br>
<code>--no-overall</code></dt>
<dd>Displays the last line of the report that summarizes the total number of
errors and warning. This option is useful in scripts that perform validation of
a large number of sources.
</dd>

</dl>



<h3>Exit status</h3>
</a>


<dl>

<dt>
<code>--fails-on-warning</code><br>
<code>--[no-]fails-on-warning</code> (default)</dt>
<dd>
Normally the program exits status is 0 if no errors were detected, or 1 if
errors were. If this option is enabled, also warnings contribute to the exit
status of 1, which may be useful in automated scripts if you want to be very
strict in validating you code base.
</dd>

</dl>


<h3>Generating the document from the source</h3>
</a>

<p>
	Once a PHP source file has been parsed and successfully checked, PHPLint
	can also generate a document in HTML format containing a detailed
	descriptions of all the public items exported by the program, the
	required modules and the required packages; hand-written DocBlocks are
	also reported and properly formatted. This HTML file is generated only
	if the <tt>--doc</tt> option is added to the command line along with the
	other options, and before the name of the source file:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
phpl --doc MyProg.php
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
	The generated file <tt>MyProg.html</tt> is saved in the same directory
	of its source file, but there are options to change this behavior.
</p>

<p>
	Another important rule is that all the references to external items
	are made relative to the current source, so that a hierarchy of related
	documents can be moved to another directory (or even to another computer)
	without breaking the references. 
</p>

<dl>
	<dt><tt>--doc</tt></dt>
	<dd>
		Enable document generation.
	</dd>

	<dt><tt>--doc-extension EXT</tt></dt>
	<dd>
		Sets the file name extension of the generated file, the default
		being <tt>.html</tt>.
	</dd>

	<dt><tt>--doc-page-header H</tt></dt>
	<dd>
		Sets the header of the HTML page, the default being simply <tt>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;</tt>.
	</dd>

	<dt><tt>--doc-page-footer F</tt></dt>
	<dd>
		Sets the footer of the HTML page, the default being something like
		<tt><i>signatureofphplint</i>&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</tt>.
	</dd>

	<dt>--doc-ref-remap A B</dt>
	<dd>
		Maps any link that starts with A into B.
	</dd>

	<dt><tt>--doc-help</tt></dt>
	<dd>
		Displays a summary of all the options related to the generation of
		the documents.
	</dd>
</dl>
