<h2 id="toc">Functions</h2>

<p>
A function is a chunk of code with a name and possibly some arguments.
Once defined, a function can be called from any scope and cannot be
re-defined. Functions cannot be nested: although PHP allows to do that,
invoking the container function twice would cause a fatal runtime error.
Differently from constants and variables, the
name of a function isn't case sensitive. However, PHPLint checks the right
spelling and raises a warning if you call a function with a name that
does not match exactly its declaration. So, for example,
<code>strlen()</code> cannot be written as <code>StrLen()</code> nor as
<code>STRLEN()</code>.
</p>

<div class="note_box">
<b>PHPLint is case-sensitive</b><br>
The general rule in PHPLint is that all the identifiers and the keywords
are always case-sensitive and must be written exactly as defined in the
PHP manual. This also holds for functions, methods an classes, that are
case-insensitive in PHP.
</div>

<p>
The <i>signature</i> of a function consists of:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Type of the returned value.</b></li>
	
	<li><b>Type and passing mode of each formal mandatory argument.</b></li>
	
	<li><b>Type and passing mode of each default argument.</b></li>
	
	<li><b>Presence of arbitrary further optional arguments.</b></li>
	
	<li><b>All the errors triggered.</b></li>
	
	<li><b>All the checked exceptions thrown.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
	The following function declaration illustrates all the elements of a
	signature using a DocBlock:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
/**
 * This function does nothing useful. Only illustrates all the
 * possible elements of a function signature. We declare this
 * function private to this package.
 * @access private
 * @param int $a First and only mandatory formal argument
 * passed by value.
 * @param int &amp; $b First and only mandatory argument passed
 * by reference.
 * @param int $d First and only default argument.
 * @return int Description of the returned type here.
 * @triggers E_NOTICE Something gone wrong.
 * @triggers E_WARNING Again, something gone wrong.
 * @throws ErrorException Something that gone wrong and you should be
 * aware of; you may catch it and recover or let the program crash.
 * @throws RuntimeException Unrecoverable problem detected, possibly
 * a bug in the program, wrong arguments, short of memory, etc.
 * Something you should not try to recover from, anyway.
 */
function f($a, &amp; $b, $d = 123 /*. , args .*/)
{
	...
}
</pre></div>


<p>
	The same declaration using PHPLint meta-code:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
/*. private int .*/ function f(
	/*. int .*/ $a,
	/*. int .*/ &amp; $b,
	$d = 123 /*. , args .*/)
/*. triggers E_WARNING, E_NOTICE
    throws ErrorException, RuntimeException .*/
{
	...
}
</pre></div>

<p>
	The two forms, DocBlock and PHPLint meta-code, are perfectly equivalent
	from the point of view of PHPLint, and can be used also mixed together.
	The main difference is that DocBlocks allows to enter useful descriptions
	that are reported in the generated documentation. The other difference is
	that PHPLint meta-code can be used also to declare function prototypes,
	where DocBlocks are not allowed.
</p>



<h3>Private functions</h3>

<p>
Functions that are private to the package and that cannot be used
by other packages can be qualified as "private" using the <code>@access private</code> line tag or the <code>/*. private .*/</code> meta-code modifier.
Private functions are reported by the PHPLint Documentator inside
the list of the <b>Private items</b> of the package.
</p>


<h3>Return type</h3>

<p>
<u>The type returned by the function is optional.</u> Normally, it can be
guessed by PHPLint parsing the first "<b>return</b> EXPR;" statement that
appears in the source: the resulting type of the expression gives the type
of the function; if the expression EXPR is missing, the function does not
return anything, then this type is <b>void</b>.
</p>


<h3>Formal arguments</h3>

<p>
<u>The type of the mandatory arguments must always be specified.</u>
	PHPLint has no other way to determinate their type.
</p>

<p>
<u>The type of a default arguments, instead, is optional</u> as it can be guessed
	from the type of the default value assigned. If the type is specified,
	the default value must be assignment-compatible with it.
	In the example above, being the default value 123 an integer number, the
	same type is assumed for the formal argument $d. For this reason, an
	explicit declaration of type is optional in this specific case (in the
	second example it has been omitted).
</p>

<p>
	Generally, only if the default value
	is NULL or the empty array, either a type or a type-cast operator on the
	generic value must be used because NULL and the empty array do not allows
	PHPLint to guess a specific type. This example illustrates all these cases
	using a combination of DocBlock and PHPLint meta-code (which makes all
	a bit confused):
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
/**
 * @param resource $file0
 * @param string[int] $names0
 */
function g(
	$file0 = NULL,
	/*. resource .*/ $file1 = NULL,
	$file2 = /*. (resource) .*/ NULL,
	$names0 = array(),
	/*. string[int] .*/ $names1 = array(),
	$names2 = /*. (string[int]) .*/ $names2)
{ ... }
</pre></div>

<p>
	In the example above, $file0, $file1 and $file2 are all resources with
	default value NULL, while $names0, $names1 and $names2 are both arrays of
	strings with integer keys and the empty array as default value.
</p>

<p>
<u>The special meta-code keyword</u> <b>args</b> tells that the function takes
a variable number of <b>optional arguments</b> that follow the mandatory
arguments and the default arguments.  For example, the function that follows
takes one mandatory argument and a variable number of optional arguments:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
/*.void.*/ function PrintArgs(/*.string.*/ $prompt /*. , args.*/)
{
    echo $prompt, "\n";
    $n = func_num_args();
    for($i = 1; $i &lt;= $n; $i++ )
        echo (string) func_get_arg($i), "\n";
}
</pre></div>

<p>
Note that a comma character is required before the <code>args</code>
meta-code keyword.
</p>



<h3>Passing method for arguments</h3>

<p>
When a function is called, every actual argument is evaluated by the
caller before being passed to the called function and assigned to the
<i>formal argument</i> inside the code of the function.
Consider, for example this chunk of code:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>
function f(
    <b>/*. int        .*/</b>   $a,   # BY VALUE
    <b>/*. return int .*/</b> &amp; $b,   # RETURN BY REFERENCE
    <b>/*. int        .*/</b> &amp; $c)   # BY REFERENCE
{
    $b = $a + $c;
    if( $c &gt; 0 )
        $c = 0;
}


$carry = -3;
f(1+2, $result, $carry);
echo $result;  # 0; $carry===0
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There are 3 passing methods:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<u>By value.</u>
The formal argument $a that appears in the declaration of the
function is a variable, local to the function, that receives an incoming value
from the evaluation of the actual argument, that is the expression
<code>1+2</code>, and this actual value is copied inside the local variable.
In a word, from the point of view of the function, arguments passed by value
are incoming values.
</li>

<li>
<u>Return by reference.</u>
The formal argument $b that appears in the declaration of the function is a
variable, local to the function, that receives a <i>reference</i> to another
variable (the actual argument $result), so that the actual and the formal
variables both refer to the same value. Then, assigning $b also $result will
be assigned. The attribute <b>return</b> is a special attribute introduced
by PHPLint telling that this argument will return a value because it will be
certainly assigned inside the function.
In other words, the <b>return</b> attribute tells that this argument represents
an outgoing value from the function to the caller.
<br>
PHPLint raises an error if the value of the variable $b is used inside the
function before being assigned. PHPLint also raises an error if $b is not
definitely assigned before exiting the function. Moreover, the actual variable
$result does not need to be assigned at the time the function gets called.
</li>

<li>
<u>By reference.</u>
The formal argument $c is a reference to an actual argument which is a variable
already assigned by the caller, $carry. Then, variables passed by reference can
be used inside the function both as incoming and as outgoing values.
<br>
PHPLint raises an error if the actual argument $carry is not definitely
assigned before the call to the function.
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Triggered errors</h3>

<p>
	<u>Listing all the triggered, non captured errors is mandatory.</u> PHPLint
	complains if the body of the function may generate any error not declared
	in the signature (errors can be handled using the "silencer" operator
	<code>@</code>).
</p>

<p>
	The following error labels are recognized:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
E_ERROR
E_WARNING
E_PARSE
E_NOTICE
E_CORE_ERROR
E_CORE_WARNING
E_COMPILE_ERROR
E_COMPILE_WARNING
E_USER_ERROR
E_USER_WARNING
E_USER_NOTICE
E_STRICT
E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR
E_DEPRECATED
E_USER_DEPRECATED
E_ALL
</pre></blockquote>


<h3>Thrown exceptions</h3>

<p>
	<u>Listing all the thrown checked exceptions is mandatory.</u>
	Listing thrown unchecked exceptions is optional. Again, PHPLint complains
	if the body of the function may throw a checked exception not listed in the
	<code>throws</code> section of the signature or in the <code>@throws</code>
	line-tag of the
	DocBlock. Listing unchecked exceptions like <code>RuntimeException</code>
	above is allowed for documenting the behavior of the function in some
	edge case. As explained in detail in the chapter about the exceptions,
	unchecked exceptions should be used to report failures related to the
	internals of the program: their generation means the program is bugged and
	should be immediately terminated to avoid even worse disasters.
