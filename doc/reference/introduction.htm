<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<b>PHPLint</b> is a parser and semantic validator for PHP
programs written in PHP itself. Moreover, <b>PHPLint</b> enhances the syntax
of the PHP language with transparent extended syntax (or meta-code) that can
drive the parser to even more strict checking of types handling, checking of
functions and methods signatures, tracking of errors exceptions detection
and propagation, and much more. You may think at PHPLint as sub-set of the
PHP programming language where only the safe and verifiable features are
retained and all the rest is forbidden or signaled as error.
</p>

<p>
The main application of the PHP language is to provide dynamic contents
to the WEB pages. Most of that pages are really simple from a programmer's point of view, and typically
involve the parsing of the HTTP request, a connection to the
data base to retrieve data, and then the presentation of the results to the
user. These applications cannot really benefit from PHPLint. Rather,
the applications where PHPLint may reveal to be really useful are the
complexes one, where much code and included libraries are involved, and
where it would be difficult to track down formal and conceptual errors.
In the next chapters we will explain how PHPLint works and how you can
get the best results programming with it.

<p>
A summary of the implemented features:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for PHP 4 and PHP 5.</li>
<li>General syntax check.</li>
<li>Strict type checking in expressions, assignments and function arguments.</li>
<li>Structured array declarations.</li>
<li>Checks functions signature usage.</li>
<li>Checks methods signature and method inheritance.</li>
<li>Recursive inclusion of the required packages.</li>
<li>Meta-code that implement C-style type declarations.</li>
<li>Check items declared but never used, or used but never declared.</li>
<li>Documentation generation.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>PHPLint</b> comes in two forms: a stand-alone program you may execute
on your computer, and a WEB version that allows you to try your code
on-line.
