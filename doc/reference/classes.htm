<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
PHP 5 introduces many new features in its OOP model: class constants,
the visibility attributes (public, protected, private), the "static"
and "final" attributes, object introspection, etc.  PHPLint generally
supports all the features of PHP5, but it adds some restrictions and
detects some weakness of the language: the differences are here detailed.
</p>

<p>
Lets see an example:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
class A {
    const a_string = "The current value is ";
    public $an_int = 1;
    private /*. mixed .*/ $anything;

    public function __construct(/*. int .*/ $n)
    { 
        $this-&gt;an_int = $n;
    }

    public function Get()
    {
        return A::a_string . $this-&gt;an_int;
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>
The only entities that require an explicit type are the property
<code>$anything</code> and the formal argument <code>$n</code>.
Constructors always return <code>void</code>, while the <code>Get()</code>
method returns <code>string</code> as guessed from the <code>return</code>
statement.
</p>


<h3>Class constants</h3>

<p>
Class constants can be declared using a syntax similar to this one:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*. <i>visibility</i> .*/ const
    CONSTNAME1 = STATICEXPR1,
    CONSTNAME2 = STATICEXPR2,
    CONSTNAME3 = STATICEXPR3;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Class constants never require (nor <b>PHPLint</b> will allow to provide)
an explicit type: the type of a constant is always given implicitly by
its value.
</p>

<p>
Class constants are <b>public</b> by default, but an explicit visibility
attribute can be provided as PHPLint meta-code.
<b>private</b> class constants are not reported by the PHPLint Documentator.
</p>

<p>
<b>Accessing.</b>
Class constants can be accessed in several ways, depending on the context:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<code>self::CONSTNAME</code>
<br>
Inside a class to access a local constant or an inherited non-private
constant.
</p>

<p>
<code>parent::CONSTNAME</code>
<br>
Inside a class to access a non-private constant of a parent class, possibly
re-defined inside the current class.
</p>

<p>
<code>CLASSNAME::CONSTNAME</code>
<br>
Everywhere to access a public constant of a class.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Collisions.</b>
A class can extend another class and can re-define some of the inherited
constants.
A class can also implement several interfaces, but constants inherited from all
these classes cannot collide and need to be all distinct.
Example:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
# All these interfaces and classes define the same constant:
interface IF1 { const x = 0; }
interface IF2 { const x = 1; }
abstract class ABS { const x = 2; }
class A { const x = 3; }

# Now testing collisions:

class B extends A {
    const x = "hello";  # re-defining A::x is allowed
                        # Note the different type
}

class C extends ABS implements IF1, IF2 {
    # ERROR: collision among inherited
    # consts ABS::x, IF1::x, IF2::x

    const x = 5;  # ERROR: collides with all the consts above
}
</pre></div>

<p>
The <code>/*.private.*/</code> meta-code attribute does not help to limit the
scope of visibility of a constant because it is not supported by PHP, so
also private constants can collide in derived classes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Re-defining.</b>
Class constants declared in interfaces and abstract classes cannot
be re-defined. Only constants inherited from concrete classes can be
re-defined.	 In this latter case the operators <code>self::CONSTNAME</code>
and <code>parent::CONSTNAME</code> allow to access the desired value in
the current or in the parent class, respectively.
</p>

<p>
<b>Overriding.</b>
Class constants cannot be overridden. From the point of view of PHPLint,
this implies that constants with the same name defined in related concrete
classes can have different types (see example above).
</p>



<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>
Classes and abstract classes can define several properties, basically
variables bound to the class (if <b>static</b>) or bound to every object
instantiated from this class (if non-static).  A property can be declared
using a syntax similar to this one:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<i>visibility</i> [<b>static</b>] [ /*. <i>x_type</i> .*/ ]
    $name1 = STATICEXPR1,
    $name2 = STATICEXPR2,
    $name3 = STATICEXPR3;
</pre>
</blockquote>

where:

<blockquote>

    <p>
    The visibility attributes are: <b>public</b>, <b>protected</b>
    or <b>private</b>.
	</p>

    <p>
    The <b>static</b> attribute marks the property to be a proper <i>class
    property</i> rather than <i>object property</i>, i.e. there is only one
    instance of this property for all the objects of this class.
    </p>

	<p>
	The visibility and the <b>static</b> attributes can be indicated in
	any order. Properties that are both <b>public</b> and <b>static</b>
	can be indicated simply being <b>static</b> omitting the other attribute.
    </p>

    <p>
    The type is optional. It is simpler and shorter to indicate a proper
    initial value, since PHPLint guesses the type of the property from the
    type of the expression. Providing both the type and the initial value
    is allowed for clearness if desired, but it is redundant. For example,
    writing
    </p>

<pre>
public $counter = 0;
public $status = array("off", "on");
public $file = /*.(resource).*/ NULL;
</pre>

    is equivalent to

<pre>
public /*. int .*/ $counter = 0;
public /*. array[int]string .*/ $status = array("off", "on");
public /*. resource .*/ $file = NULL;
</pre>

    <p>
	The initial value <code>STATICEXPRn</code> is optional and, if provided,
	its type must match the x_type. Remember that properties without an
	initial value are initialized to the value NULL; in this case the
	responsibility to assign them a proper initial value is left to the
	constructor method.
    </p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<b>private</b> properties can be re-defined inside the derived classes,
but this is not a proper "overriding", since the methods of the child
and of the extended class each one access its own properties.
</p>

<p>
<b>public</b> and <b>protected</b> properties cannot be redefined in extended
classes (PHPLint restriction).
</p>

<div class="note_box">
<b>boolean, in and float properties MUST be initialized with a value</b><br>
The PHP interpreter initializes all the properties that lack an initial value
to the NULL value. According to the type model of PHPLint, the NULL value is
not allowed for variables of simple type <b>boolean</b>, <b>int</b> or
<b>float</b>. In these cases PHPLint requires that an initial value be always
specified, for example <code>FALSE</code>, <code>0</code> or <code>0.0</code>
respectively otherwise an error is signaled.
</div>

<p>
<b>Accessing.</b>
Properties can be accessed in several ways, depending on the context
and on their attributes:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<code>$this-&gt;v</code>
<br>
Inside a non-static method to access a local non-static property, or an
inherited <b>public</b>|<b>protected</b>, non-static property.
</p>

<p>
<code>$obj-&gt;v</code>
<br>
Everywhere to access a non-static, <b>public</b> property.  Note that
<b>protected</b> properties are not accessible this way, but only through
$this-&gt;v or self::$v.  Accessing via $obj-&gt; to <b>protected</b>
properties is forbidden (PHPLint restriction).
</p>

<p>
<code>self::$v</code>
<br>
Inside a method to access a local <b>static</b> property, or an inherited
<b>public</b>|<b>protected</b>, <b>static</b> property.
</p>

<p>
<code>parent::$v</code>
<br>
Inside a method to access an inherited <b>public</b>|<b>protected static</b>
property. Since in PHPLint the non-private properties cannot be re-defined,
nor public|protected properties can be overridden, this gives the same
as <code>self::$v</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>CLASSNAME::$v</code>
<br>
Everywhere to access a <b>static</b>, <b>public</b> property.
</p>

</blockquote>


<p>
<b>Re-defining.</b>
Only <b>private</b> properties can be re-defined in extended classes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Overriding.</b>
Properties cannot be overridden (PHPLint restriction).
</p>

<table align=center width="70%"><tr><td>
NOTE. PHP allows to override properties, but the overridden property gets
shadowed by the new one and cannot be accessed anymore, neither from its
own class.
</td></tr></table>



<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>
A method can be declared using a syntax similar to this one:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<i>[visibility]</i> <i>[</i>static<i>]</i> <i>[</i>final<i>]</i> /*. <i>x_type</i> .*/
function methodName(<i>arguments</i>)
{
    // the code here
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
As of PHP 5.3.3, in namespaced classes the constructor method must be called
<tt>__construct()</tt>. In PHPLint the constructor method must be always
called <tt>__construct()</tt> and a warning is raised on methods that have the
same name of the class.
</p>


<h4>Methods attributes</h4>

<p>
A method is basically a function that can have several attributes,
in any order.
</p>

<p>
The allowed visibility attributes for methods are:
<b>public</b> (the default), <b>protected</b> or <b>private</b>.
</p>

<p>
The <b>static</b> attribute marks the method to be a proper <i>class
method</i> rather than an <i>instance method</i>, so this methods
is not bound to a particular object. <b>static</b> methods cannot use
the special variable <code>$this</code> (PHPLint restriction).
</p>

<p>
The <b>final</b> attribute marks methods that cannot be overridden.
</p>

<p>
The type of the returned value isn't mandatory since PHPLint can guess
the type from the <code>return</code> statement, but it is recommended
be always indicated explicitly.
Methods that do not return a value should be <b>void</b>.
</p>


<h4>Inheritance and methods overriding</h4>

<p>
A class B is said to be a <i>subclass</i> of the class A if the class
B extends the class A or if the class B extends a class X that is a
subclass of A (note the recursive definition). For example:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>
class A {
    function a() {}
}

class B extends A {
    function a() {}
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Normally, the names of the methods of a subclass differ from any other
method of its parent class.  However, the subclass B can override
the method A::a() of its parent class defining the overriding
method B::a().
</p>

<p>
The basic rule of the polymorphism in OOP is that <i>overridden methods
must be usable exactly as the original ones</i>. For example, if A::a()
is expected to return a string, the overriding method B::a() must return
a string; if A::a() requires two mandatory arguments, also B::a() must be
callable with two arguments.
PHPLint checks accurately every overridden method: the signature, the
attributes and the thrown exceptions are compared and possible
incompatibilities are detected.
PHP 5 already does some checks on the attributes and on the number of
mandatory and default arguments, but PHPLint enhance these restrictions to
the types of the arguments,
and the possible presence of optional arguments <code>/*.args.*/</code>,
the type of the returned value,
and the exceptions thrown.
Lets start defining what a signature is.
</p>

<p>
The <i>signature</i> of a method is composed of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the type of the returned value, possibly <b>void</b></li>
<li>the ordered list of the types of the mandatory arguments</li>
<li>the ordered list of the types of the default arguments</li>
<li>possible presence of a variable number of arguments  <b>/*.args.*/</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, the signature of the method
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<code>/*.int.*/ function a(/*.int.*/ $a, $b=3.14 /*., args.*/)
</code></div>

<p>
is <code>int(int,[float],...)</code> with one mandatory argument ($a), one
default argument ($b) and possibly a list of more optional arguments.
</p>

<p>
The attributes, the signature and the list of the exceptions thrown
of the overriding method B::a() are subject to these restrictions:
</p>

<ul>

<li>The two methods must have the same name (ok, that's obvious...).
</li>

<li><b>final</b> methods cannot be overridden (PHP 5 restriction).
</li>

<li><b>private</b> methods cannot be re-defined (PHP 5 limitation,
    but see the note 1).
</li>

<li>The visibility of the new method must be the same or greater:
    if A::a() is protected, B::a() can be either protected or public;
    if A::a() is public, B::a() must be public (PHP 5 restriction).
</li>

<li>The two methods must be both non-static or both <b>static</b>
    (PHP 5 restriction).
</li>

<li>
The signature of the overriding method must be compatible with the
signature of the overridden method, that is:

	<ul>

	<li>
	The return type must be the same of the overridden method.
	If the return type is an object, it may also be a sub-class.
	</li>

	<li>
	For each matching formal argument, the passing method (by value, return
	by reference or by reference) must be the same.
	</li>

	<li>
	The type of each argument must be the same of the overridden method.
	If the argument is an object passed by value, it may also be a sub-class.
	</li>

	<li>
	If the parent method has only mandatory arguments (or no arguments
	at all), the overriding method can add default arguments and
	optional arguments.
	</li>

	<li>
	If the parent method has default arguments, the overriding method can
	add more default arguments and optional arguments.
	</li>

	</ul>
</li>

<li>
	The new method can throw the same exceptions inherited from the
	original method, or even subclasses of them; throwing other exceptions
	is not allowed. The chapter devoted to the exceptions provides more
	details about this topic.
</li>

<li>
	The set of declared thrown exceptions must be a class subset of the
	the set of the declared exceptions in the original method.
	In particular, note that is the original method does not declares
	any thrown exception, the new method cannot throw checked exceptions
	at all.
	See the chapter devoted to the exceptions for more details.
</li>


</ul>

<p>
In this example, the subclass B overrides all the methods of its parent class
A. The body of all the methods is left empty, since it does not matter in
our discussion. Note that B::g() adds a default argument $y, while B::h()
adds a variable number of optional arguments and raises its visibility from
<b>protected</b> to <b>public</b>.
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>
class A {
    public /*. void .*/ function f(){}

    public /*. int  .*/ function g(/*. int .*/ $i){}

    protected /*. void .*/ function h(/*. int .*/ $x){}
}

class B extends A {
    public /*. void .*/ function f(){}

    public /*. int  .*/ function g(
        /*. int .*/ $x,
        /*. int .*/ $y = 0)
    {}

    public /*. void .*/ function h(/*. int .*/ $x /*., args .*/){}
}
</pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>NOTE 1.</b> PHP 5 does not allow to re-define a private method, and it
checks the new method as it were an overriding one. This implies that a
different number of arguments generates a warning when the E_STRICT mode
is enabled.  It seems to me a little bug, since I'm used to split complex
methods into several little private functions with short, trivial names;
these utility functions should not be visible outside the class.
</p>

<p>
Workaround: avoid trivial names for private methods. For example, if the
method <code>Items::printList()</code> needs an utility function that
sort the list before be printed, you can call this private function
something like <code>Items::printList_sort()</code>, and not simply
<code>Items::sort()</code>: not only this prevent collisions with possible
other private methods of extended classes, but it also make clear to
the human reader of the source that this is an utility method bound to
<code>printList()</code>.
</blockquote>
<pre>

</pre>



<h4>Accessing to the methods</h4>

<p>
Methods can be accessed in several ways, depending on the context
and on their attributes:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<code>$this-&gt;f()</code>
<br>
Inside a non-static method to access a local non-static method, or an
inherited <b>public</b>|<b>protected</b>, non-static method.
</p>

<p>
<code>self::f()</code>
<br>
Inside a method to access a local <b>static</b> method, or an inherited
<b>public</b>|<b>protected</b>, <b>static</b> method.
</p>

<p>
<code>parent::f()</code>
<br>
Inside a method to access an inherited <b>public</b>|<b>protected</b>
<b>static</b>|non-static method. Useful if the inherited method has
been overridden, so <code>parent::f()</code> is the original method,
while <code>$this->f()</code> (if non-static) or <code>self::f()</code>
(if static) is the overriding one. Note the usage of the <i>static
resolution operator</i> "<code>::</code>" also for non-static methods:
in fact in this case the dynamic binding does not take place since the
method we are referring to is statically determined.  The typical
usage is calling the parent constructor from the derived class using
<code>parent::__construct();</code> (remember that if the derived class
has a constructor, the parent constructor isn't called automatically, but
it must be called explicitly from the constructor of the derived class).
</p>

<p>
<code>CLASSNAME::f()</code>
<br>
Everywhere to access a static, public method.
</p>

<p>
<code>$obj-&gt;f()</code>
<br>
Everywhere to access a non-static, <b>public</b> method.
<b>protected</b> methods are not accessible this way (PHPLint restriction).
</p>

</blockquote>


<p>
PHPLint will raise an error message if a <b>static</b> method does use the
special variable <code>$this</code> (PHPLint restriction).
</p>


<h3>Special methods</h3>

<p>
<b>Constructors.</b>
A constructor method <code>__construct()</code> can have a visibility
attribute, then the usual visibility rules apply. For example, note that if
the constructor is <b>private</b> or <b>protected</b>, objects of its class
can be instantiated only inside the class itself (if <b>private</b>) and
the constructor can be called by the extended classes (if <b>protected</b>).
</p>

<p>
A class constructor cannot be <b>abstract</b> nor <b>static</b>.
</p>

<p>
The signature of a class constructor must return <code>void</code> and it
may contain arbitrary formal arguments, since its signature is not compared
with that of the parent class (constructors do not "override" constructors).
</p>

<p>
A class constructor is called implicitly by the <b>new</b> operator; it
cannot be called explicitly with the only exception of the constructor of
the derived classes (PHPLint restriction).
</p>

<p>
A constructor must call explicitly its parent constructor if one exists,
since in this case PHP would not call automatically the constructor of the
parent class.  It is an error if the constructor of the derived class omits
to call the parent constructor through <code>parent::__construct();</code>
(PHPLint restriction).
</p>

<p>
<b>Destructors.</b>
A class destructor <code>__destruct()</code> can have a visibility attribute.
Destructors are invoked automatically by the PHP interpreter once the object
has no more references. Destructors cannot be called explicitly by the program
(with the only exception of the destructor of the derived class; see below).
</p>

<p>
Note that <b>private</b> and <b>protected</b> destructors cannot be invoked
outside their class or their derived classes, so that if the destruction
of an object occurs outside the visibility context of this method, the
PHP interpreter raises a warning message. Since PHPLint cannot practically
determine in which context the object of this class will be destroyed,
it cannot check the proper usage of the <b>private</b> and <b>protected</b>
attributes applied to destructors, so it imposes these methods be always
<b>public</b> (PHPLint limitation).
</p>

<p>
A class destructor cannot be <b>abstract</b> nor <b>static</b>.
</p>

<p>
A class destructor must return <code>void</code> and it cannot have formal
arguments.
</p>

<p>
Thus the only allowed signature of a destructor is as follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
function __destruct(){ ... }
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
A destructor must call explicitly its parent destructor if one exists,
since in this case PHP would not call automatically the destructor of the
parent class.  It is an error if the destructor of the derived class omits
to call the parent destructor through <code>parent::__destruct();</code>
(PHPLint restriction).
</p>

<h3>Abstract classes</h3>

<p>
The general syntax of an abstract class can be informally described as
follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
/*. private .*/ abstract class CLASSNAME
    extends ANOTHER_ABSTRACT_CLASS
    implements INTERFACE1, INTERFACE2
{
	<i>constants
	properties
	abstract methods
	concrete methods</i>
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
An abstract class is similar to any other concrete class, but with three
important differences: 1. it can contain abstract methods; 2. it cannot be
instantiated with the <b>new</b> operator; 3. derived, concrete classes must
implement all the abstract methods defined inside the abstract class; if the
abstract class extends another abstract class, or implements some interfaces,
the concrete class must also implement the inherited abstract methods.

<p>
The basic properties of abstract classes are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Abstract classes are intended to be a model for other "concrete" classes,
so that all the extended classes derived from them share a common behavior. As
a logical consequence, abstract classes cannot be <b>final</b>.
</li>


<li>
An abstract class can extend another abstract class and can implement
several interfaces.  The extended abstract class inherits the properties, the
methods and the abstract methods of its parent class and parent interfaces.
</li>

<li>
A concrete (i.e. non-abstract) class MUST implement all the abstract
methods inherited from the abstract class it extends.
</li>

<li>
Your program can process abstract objects that belong to an abstract
class, whatever the concrete class to which they actually belong may
be.
</li>

<li>
Objects cannot be instantiated from an abstract class.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Abstract classes can be private to the package: in this case also any
derived class must be private.	Abstract classes cannot be <b>final</b>,
since they are useful only if they can be extended.
</p>

<p>
Abstract classes can extend another abstract class, and can implement
several interfaces. The abstract class itself may implement some of the
inherited abstract methods.
</p>

<p>
Constants inherited from the implemented interfaces and from the extended
class, and properties inherited from the extended class cannot collide
together nor they can collide with the items defined inside the abstract
class.
</p>

<p>
Instead, a method can override or implement several methods inherited from the
extended classes and from implemented interfaces, provided that this method be
compatible with all them.
</p>

<p>
An abstract method is a public, non-static, non-final method that has the
<b>abstract</b> qualifier, and its body is substituted by a semicolon:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
abstract class Shape
{
    const DEF_SCALE = 1.0;

    public $x = 0.0, $y = 0.0;

    function moveTo(/*. float .*/ $x, /*. float .*/ $y)
    {
        $this-&gt;x = $x;
        $this-&gt;y = $y;
    }

    abstract /*. void .*/ function scale(/*. float .*/ $factor) ;
}
</pre></div>

<p>
This class describes a generic geometric shape that can be moved and
scaled.	 The position is a property that can be defined for any shape,
so the <code>moveTo()</code> method can be <i>concrete</i>. On the contrary,
scaling a generic shape cannot be implemented in a general way and the
method implementing this feature only declares its interface but not its code,
i.e. it is <i>abstract</i>.
</p>

<p>
Since the method <code>scale()</code> is abstract, it must be
implemented in any derived, concrete, class:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
class Circle extends Shape
{
    public $radius = 1.0;

    function scale(/*. float .*/ $factor)
    {
        $this-&gt;radius *= $factor;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape
{
    public $side_a = 1.0, $side_b = 2.0;

    function scale(/*. float .*/ $factor)
    {
        $this-&gt;side_a *= $factor;
        $this-&gt;side_b *= $factor;
    }
}
</pre></div>


<p>
Abstract classes are useful to describe data structures and deal with them
without knowing their actual nature. For example, this chunk of code declares
a drawing as a list of shapes and declares a function that scale them all:
</p>


<div class="code_box"><pre>
$drawing = /*. (array[int]Shape) .*/ array();

function scale_shapes(/*. float .*/ $factor)
{
    foreach($GLOBALS['drawing'] as $shape)
        $shape->scale($factor);
}


$drawing[] = new Circle();
$drawing[] = new Circle();
$drawing[] = new Rectangle();
scale_shapes(10.0);
</pre></div>


<h3>Interfaces</h3>

<p>
The syntax of an interface can be described informally as follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
/*. private .*/ interface NAME
    extends INTERFACE1, INTERFACE2
{
	<i>public constants
	abstract methods</i>
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
An interface is similar to an abstract class declaring only constants and
abstract methods.  Basically, interfaces are used as "syntactical glue"
between different classes, and are not really necessary for a scripting
language as PHP is.  Nevertheless, interfaces are an important feature in
complex applications:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Concrete and abstract classes can extend only one class, but can implement
several interfaces.
</li>

<li>
PHP (and PHPLint too) ensures that all the indicated abstract methods be
actually implemented, so that all the classes implementing a given interface
will exhibit the same behaviour.
</li>

<li>
Interfaces help in documenting the source, as the various relationships
among related classes become evident.
</li>

<li>
PHPLint and PHP 5 can understand the actual intention of the programmer,
so they can help to debug the program both at validation-time and at
run-time respectively.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Constants and abstract methods inherited from the extended interfaces
cannot collide together and cannot collide with items defined inside
the interface.
</p>

<p>
Properties are not allowed in interfaces (PHP 5 restriction).
You can still force implementing classes to define some accessor methods (also
known as "setters" and "getters") to write and read the property. The following
example illustrates two accessor methods allowing to read and write the
property "xxx":
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
interface IAccessorsDemo
{
    /*. void .*/ function setXxx(/*. int .*/ $value);
    /*. int  .*/ function getXxx();
}
</pre></div>

<p>
Constructor methods are allowed in interfaces only since PHP 5.2.0.
</p>

<p>
All the methods must be abstract, public and non-final, but the
<b>abstract</b> attribute is not required, since all the methods of an
interface must be abstract.
</p>

<p>
Methods can be <b>static</b>.
</p>

<p>
An interface can extend several other interfaces, so inheriting all their
abstract methods.
</p>

<p>
Interfaces cannot be instantiated into an object, so the <b>new</b> operator
cannot be applied to an interface. Interfaces can be extended by other
interfaces, and can be implemented by abstract and concrete classes.
</p>

<p>
In the following example, an interface describes the methods that a generic
"data container" must provide.  Every datum has a name and a value; the
methods set() and get() allow to store/retrieve that value.  The abstraction
introduced by this class is that the medium where these data have to be stored
is left to the implementation of the interface. Several implementations
can follow different strategies, for example data can be stored in memory,
in the user session, inside a DB, etc.  The point is that the software
written in terms of this interface becomes largely independent from the
implementation we can choose.
</p>

<p>
Two (very crude) concrete classes implementing this interface are also defined,
then an example that stores a copy of the $_SESSION[] data is shown.
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>interface DataContainer
{
    /*. void .*/ function set(
        /*. string .*/ $name,
        /*. string .*/ $value);

    /*. string .*/ function get(/*. string .*/ $name);
}


class MemoryBasedContainer implements DataContainer
{
    private $data = /*.(array[string]string).*/ array();

    /*. void .*/ function set(
        /*. string .*/ $name,
        /*. string .*/ $value)
    {
        $this->data[$name] = $value;
    }

    /*. string .*/ function get(/*. string .*/ $name)
    {
        if( isset($this->data[$name]) )
            return $this->data[$name];
        else
            return NULL;
    }
}


class FileBasedContainer implements DataContainer
{
    private $base_dir = "";

    /*. void .*/ function __construct(/*. string .*/ $base_dir)
    {
        $this->base_dir = $base_dir;
    }

    /*. void .*/ function set(
        /*. string .*/ $name,
        /*. string .*/ $value)
    {
        file_put_contents($this->base_dir ."/". $name, $value);
    }

    /*. string .*/ function get(/*. string .*/ $name)
    {
        $fn = $this->base_dir ."/". $name;
        if( ! file_exists($fn) )  return NULL;
        return file_get_contents($fn);
    }
}


class DbBasedContainer implements DataContainer
{
    /* etc etc etc */
}


function save_session_data(/*. DataContainer .*/ $c)
{
    foreach($_SESSION as $k => $v)
        $c->set($k, serialize($v));
}


$c = /*. (DataContainer) .*/ NULL;

switch( SAVE_METHOD ){
    case SAVE_ON_MEMORY: $c = new MemoryBasedContainer(); break;
    case SAVE_ON_FILE:   $c = new FileBasedContainer("/tmp"); break;
    case SAVE_ON_DBASE:  $c = new DbBasedContainer(); break;
}

save_session_data($c);
/* ... */</pre>
</div>


<p>
Note that the function <code>save_session_data()</code> formally accepts an
object from a class that cannot be instantiated. This is obviously a
syntactical trick that simply says: well, my dear function, whatever the actual
object may be, that object will behave as specified by the
<code>DataContainer</code> interface, so that the methods specified there will
be available.
</p>

<p>
Note that the same code would work perfectly on PHP also omitting the interface
declaration at all, as the type of the variable $c is dynamically determined
and the method calls are always dynamically resolved at run-time. Yet, the
interface makes evident to the human reader (an to PHPLint) which are the
features shared by every instance of the object $c.
