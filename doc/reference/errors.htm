<h2 id="toc">Errors</h2>


<p>
This chapter explains how errors raised by PHP at runtime can be detected, and
how PHPLint's error tracking feature works to help programmers being aware of
any potential error source. This chapter also explains another important
feature of PHPLint named <i>errors mapping into exceptions</i> that allows to
handle errors just like any other exception.
</p>



<h3>Fully handling of errors</h3>

<p>
Several functions of the PHP standard library may signal an error of level
E_WARNING if something goes wrong. These errors are not fatal, in the
sense that a message is logged and then the program continues,
badly crashing or causing others unpredictable disasters:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
$fn = "file-that-does-not-exist.txt";
$f = fopen($fn, "r");
$data = fread($f, filesize($fn));
fclose($f);
</pre></div>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>==&gt;
PHP Warning:  fopen(file-that-does-not-exist.txt): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php on line 5
PHP Warning:  filesize(): stat failed for file-that-does-not-exist.txt in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php on line 6
PHP Warning:  fread() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php on line 6
PHP Warning:  fclose() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php on line 7
</b>
</pre></blockquote>



<p>
So, it is
responsibility of the programmer to check for possible errors and to take
counter measures appropriate for the case. Usually a simple <tt>die()</tt>
does the job, as there is nothing else the program can do:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
$fn = "file-that-does-not-exist.txt";
$f = fopen($fn, "r");
if( $f === FALSE )
    die("can't read data file");
$data = fread($f, filesize($fn));
fclose($f);
</pre></div>

<blockquote><pre>
<b>==&gt;
PHP Warning:  fopen(file-that-does-not-exist.txt): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php on line 5
can't read data file
</b>
</pre></blockquote>


<p>
Note that in the example above if the opening of the file fails, then an error
message is logged or displayed on the screen depending on the configuration.
The programmer may also take care to generate meaningful error
messages prepending the silencer operator <tt>@</tt> to the function that may
fail, as in the example below:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
$fn = "file-that-does-not-exist.txt";
$f = <b>@</b>fopen($fn, "r");
if( $f === FALSE )
    die("can't read data file: " . $php_errormsg);
$data = fread($f, filesize($fn));
fclose($f);
</pre></div>

<blockquote><pre>
<b>==&gt;
can't read data file: fopen(file-that-does-not-exist.txt): failed to open stream: No such file or directory
</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
But, if the programmer omits to performs these checks on the functions that may
fail, the result may be unpredictable and potentially might compromise the
safety of the system. PHPLint helps signaling all the functions it knows may
fail, but PHPLint cannot guarantee these errors are correctly handled by the
program.
</p>


<h3>Triggering errors and errors inheritance</h3>

<p>
Not only the functions (and methods) of the standard library may fail. Also the
user's defined functions (and methods) may fail, either intentionally calling
the <tt>trigger_error()</tt> function, or omitting to handle errors that may be
raised by other functions called in their body. PHPLint collects all the errors
that are triggered inside a function (or method) and all the errors that are not
silenced, and then PHPLint signals these errors every time that function (or
method) gets used next, so making aware the programmer that these functions
generate or inherit errors that should be handled in some way.
</p>



<h3>Mapping errors into exceptions</h3>

<p>
Under PHP 5, PHPLint allows to enable the mapping of errors into
an exception through the <tt>error_throws_exception</tt> pragma:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><tt>
/*. pragma 'error_throws_exception' 'ErrorException'; .*/
</tt></div>

<p>
This pragma tells to PHPLint that errors of any level must be handled just like
an exception of type ErrorException. Then, for example, triggering an error
with <tt>trigger_error("Message", E_USER_ERROR);</tt> is just like throwing an
exception with <tt>new&nbsp;ErrorException("Message");</tt>.
The standard library of PHPLint provides the <tt>errors.php</tt> package
that takes advantage from this pragma to implement error mapping into
exceptions using the <tt>set_error_handler()</tt> function. So, simply
including this package you get two important benefits: unhandled errors
always causes an immediate interruption of the program, whereas handled errors
can be detected with the standard <tt>try/catch</tt> statement.
Here is an example of what happens with an unhandled error:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
require_once "errors.php";
$fn = "file-that-does-not-exist.txt";
$f = fopen($fn, "r");
if( $f === FALSE )
    die("can't read data file");
$data = fread($f, filesize($fn));
fclose($f);
</pre></div>

<blockquote><pre>
<b>==&gt;
Uncaught exception 'ErrorException' with message 'E_WARNING: fopen(file-that-does-not-exist.txt): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php:5' in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/errors.php:49
Stack trace:
#0 [internal function]: error_handler(2, 'fopen(file-that...', '/home/salsi/src...', 5, Array)
#1 /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php(5): fopen('file-that-does-...', 'r')
#2 {main}
</b>
</pre></blockquote>


<p>
Errors raised by the functions of the standard library are mapped into
exceptions too, then we may catch these errors in the standard way:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
require_once "errors.php";
$fn = "file-that-does-not-exit.txt";
try {
    $f = fopen($fn, "r");
    $data = fread($f, filesize($fn));
    fclose($f);
}
catch( ErrorException $e ){
    echo "can't access data file: $e\n";
}
</pre></div>

<blockquote><pre>
<b>==&gt;
can't read data file file-that-does-not-exist.txt: fopen(file-that-does-not-exist.txt): failed to open stream: No such file or directory
</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
Since errors cannot be silenced anymore with the <tt>@</tt> operator, the
programmer now MUST take care to handle errors or leave its program facing its
destiny, that is abrupt termination on error. And note that "minor" errors that
normally would produce an (apparently) harmless E_NOTICE, now may interrupt the
program. This is the case, for example, when an unassigned variable is used:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>
require_once "errors.php";
echo $unassigned_variable;
</pre></div>

<blockquote><pre>
<b>==&gt;
Uncaught exception 'ErrorException' with message 'E_NOTICE: Undefined variable: unassigned_variable in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php:4' in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/errors.php:49
Stack trace:
#0 /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php(4): error_handler(8, 'Undefined varia...', '/home/salsi/src...', 4, Array)
#1 {main}
</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Usage of unassigned variables can be prevented taking seriously the error
messages signaled by PHPLint as "<i>variable `$xxx' has not been assigned</i>"
and also "<i>variable $xxx might not have been assigned</i>" in case of
variables that are not definitely assigned (see chapter "Definite assignment
analysis").
</p>

<p>
Instead, accessing array's elements that do not exit is a bug that can be
detected only at runtime, and it throws an exception:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>
require_once "errors.php";
$a = array("zero", "one", "two");
echo $a[3];
</pre></div>

<blockquote><pre>
<b>==&gt;
Uncaught exception 'ErrorException' with message 'E_NOTICE: Undefined offset: 3 in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php:5' in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/errors.php:49
Stack trace:
#0 /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/err-test.php(5): error_handler(8, 'Undefined offse...', '/home/salsi/src...', 5, Array)
#1 {main}
</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, you should always check in advance for the existence of an entry in the
array whenever you are not sure that this entry really exists. This is the
case, for example, of the arrays like $_GET[], $_POST[], $_FILES[], $_COOKIE,
$SESSION[], $_ENV[] and any other array whose structure is not under the
control of our program but comes from an external source. So, always use
<tt>isset()</tt> before accessing the value:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
require_once "errors.php";
if( isset($_GET["parameter") and is_string($_GET["parameter"]) )
    $parameter = $_GET["parameter"];
else
    $parameter = "default-value";
</pre></div>

<p>
You must pay attention to the <tt>unserialize()</tt> function when applied
to arbitrary data, as it raises an exception if the data cannot be recognized
because corrupted, as it may be the case of serialized data retrieved from
a file:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
require_once "errors.php";
require_once "autoload.php";
require_once "cast.php";
try {
    $fn = "users-data.bin";
    $f = fopen($fn, "r");
    $users_s = fread($f, filesize($fn));
    fclose($f);
    $users = cast("array[int]User", unserialize($users_s));
} 
catch(ErrorException $e){
    echo "retrieving users data from $fn: ", $e-&gt;getMessage();
    exit;
}
</pre></div>

<blockquote><pre>
<b>==&gt;
retrieving serialized data from users-data.bin: E_NOTICE: unserialize(): Error at offset 650 of 8355 bytes in /home/salsi/src/phplint/stdlib/test-unserialize.php:19
</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that PHP un this case raises a bare E_NOTICE that most PHP programmers
ignore, although the data retrieved from the file are corrupted and the
expected object of the class User cannot be reconstructed: this is another
case in which paying attention also to the "notices" helps making the program
safer. Note also the usage of the magic function <tt>cast()</tt> described in
the chapter "PHPLint's Standard Library"; this function checks at runtime that
the reconstructed object be really of the type we expect, in this case an array
of User objects; autoloading also guarantees the User class be defined, and then
all its methods be restored.
