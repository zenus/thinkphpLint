<h2 id="toc">Recursive declarations</h2>

<p>
PHPLint is a single-pass parser. With this design, the program becomes simple
and fast. The drawback is that every item has to be declared before be used,
and the programmer is forced to declare functions, classes and methods in a
strict bottom-up order: low-level come first, high-level ones next. However
there are cases in which functions (or even methods and classes) must call each
other recursively because this may be the "natural" way to resolve some complex
algorithms. PHPLint resolves these cases through the <b>forward
declaration</b>.
</p>

<p>
Forward declarations are meta-code statements that may declare the
<b>prototype</b> of a function, a class or a method, so that these elements can
be used before being fully declared in actual PHP code.
</p>

<p>
All the prototypes declared in a file MUST have their corresponding full
code declaration in the same file. When PHPLint ends parsing a file, in
fact, it checks that all the prototypes declared in that file be resolved
in actual PHP code.
</p>


<h3>Function prototypes</h3>

<p>
Function prototypes MUST be declared at global scope. Function prototypes
cannot be declared inside a function or inside a method. This also means that
function prototypes cannot be used inside files included by a function.
</p>

<p>
Function prototypes MUST fully declare the signature of the function, including
returned type and argument types, as in this example:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<code>/*. forward void function Location(string $url = ); .*/</code>
</div>

<p>
Note the reserved keyword <b>forward</b> that marks the prototype. Note also
that the expression giving the default value of the argument must be left
empty, so that this value can be indicated only once for all where the
actual code is implemented.
</p>

<p>
The actual code implementing this prototype MUST match exactly the signature
of the prototype. Here we can rely on the guesses PHPLint performs, but the
resulting signature must be that expected. For example, the function above
can be implemented in code omitting the returned type, as this type can
be guessed by PHPLint:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>function Location(/*. string .*/ $url = NULL)
{
    if( $url === NULL )
        header("Location: http://www.mysite.com/");
    else
        header("Location: $url");
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that the $url argument has a default value, and this default value has
been explicitly given only in the actual PHP code and was omitted in the
prototype.
</p>

<p>
Function prototypes can include also the <b>private</b> attribute and
the <b>args</b> formal argument. The following example illustrates
a private function that has a mandatory argument, a default argument
and zero or more optional arguments:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>/*. forward private void function
    print_list(string $label, string $sept=, args); .*/
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The implementation in actual PHP code must match the same signature:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>/*. private void .*/ function print_list(
    /*. string .*/ $label,
    /*. string .*/ $sept = ", "
    /*., args .*/)
{
    #...
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A prototype of function can also declare a set of thrown checked exceptions. In
the actual function the set of declared thrown exceptions must be a class
subset of the the set of the declared exceptions in the prototype. In
particular, note that if the prototype does not declares any thrown exception,
the actual function cannot throw checked exceptions at all. See the chapter
devoted to the exceptions for more details.
</p>

<p>
None of the examples above actually required a prototype, as none of the
functions depends recursively from another function (or class).
If you know any concrete, short example that illustrates the actual need
for recursive functions, please let me know and I will add it here.
</p>


<h3>Method prototypes</h3>

<p>
Recursive calls arise also within the methods of a class. In this case some of
the methods have to be declared <b>forward</b>. Methods prototypes are just
like function prototypes, with the only difference that methods may have also
their proper attributes, visibility, <b>static</b> and <b>final</b>.
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>
class Data {

    /*.
        forward public void function __construct(string $value);
        forward public Data function getMoreData();
    .*/

    # From now on __construct() and getMoreData() can be used by
    # any method and can be declared in PHP code in any order.
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A prototype of method can also declare a set of thrown checked exceptions. In
the actual method the set of declared thrown exceptions must be a class subset
of the set of the declared exceptions in the prototype. In particular, note
that if the prototype does not declares any thrown exception, the actual
method cannot throw checked exceptions at all. See the chapter devoted to the
exceptions for more details.
</p>



<h3>Class prototypes</h3>

<p>
A class prototype declares the class name and possibly the signature of some of
its methods. There is not need to list the signatures of all the methods that
will be actually declared in the actual PHP code, but only those that are
involved in recursive declarations or recursive calls. When only the class
name is involved in a recursive declaration, defining a forward class
is sufficient:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>/*.  forward class A {}  .*/

class B {

    private $a = /*. (A) .*/ NULL;

    /*. A .*/ function getA(){ return $this->a; }
}

class A {

    private $b = /*. (B) .*/ NULL;

    /*. B .*/ function getB(){ return $this->b; }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In more complex cases of recursive dependency among classes, the A class also
call some methods of B and vice-versa. In this case we declare the prototype of
the first class along the methods that are required by the B class:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>/*.
forward class A {
    void function __construct(mixed $x);
    int  function someMethod();
}
.*/

class B {
    # Here we can use the A class
    # and the methods A::__construct()
    # and A::someMethod().
}

class A {
    # Finally, here is the A class,
    # that may fully use B and its
    # methods.
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Programmers accustomed to split their program source one class per file,
may encounter a problem when defining classes that have recursive references.
Lets take for example two classes A and B, each one declared in its own
file A.php and B.php respectively. Now suppose both the classes need the other
one, for example each class has a method that return an object of the other
class. Here is structure of the source that resolves the recursive references:
</p>

File A.php:
<div class="code_box"><pre>
&lt;?php

/*. forward class A{} .*/

require_once 'B.php';

class A {
    /*. B .*/ function m(){}
}
</pre></div>


File B.php:
<div class="code_box"><pre>
&lt;?php

/*. forward class B{} .*/

require_once 'A.php';

class B {
    /*. A .*/ function n(){}
}
</pre></div>


We note that:

<ul>

<li>
In every file, the class is declared <b>forward</b>, then the other file is
included, and finally the <b>forward</b> class is declared in its actual PHP
code. The order of these elements is essential.
</li>

<li>
Every file has a <b>forward</b> declaration for the same class that is declared
just few lines below in the same file, that make easier to maintain the source
in case some change be made.
</li>

<li>
Each file of this example can be parsed separately by PHPLint, as the
<code>require_once</code> statements give to PHPLint (and to PHP as well) the
exact loading sequence of all the classes involved. Moreover, the client
packages can load any of the two files or even both in any order, since the
<code>require_once</code> statement ensures all the required files be loaded.
</li>

</ul>
