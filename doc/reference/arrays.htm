<h2 id="toc">Arrays</h2>

<p>
PHP implements arrays as hash tables whose indices can be either integers
and strings of characters, possibly mixed together in the same array.
There are no restrictions on the type of the elements stored inside an
array, and they can be all of different types inside the same array.
Very simple to use, very powerful for quick-and-dirty programming,
very dangerous.
</p>

<p>
Not surprisingly, PHPLint introduces some restriction on how an array
can be defined and used.
</p>



<h3>The structured array type</h3>

<p>
Simply declaring that a value is of the type <b>array</b> does not give
very much information to the parser. So, <b>PHPLint</b> allows a more
accurate description of the array structure that provides the type of the
index (<b>int</b>, <b>string</b> or both) and the type of the elements
and that can be expressed informally as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<code><i>E</i>[<i>K</i>]</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
where <i>K</i> is the type of the index (<b>int</b> or <b>string</b> or both if
empty) and <i>E</i> is the type of the elements.
Arrays can also be declared in the old form
</p>

<blockquote>
<code>array[<i>K</i>]<i>E</i></code>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this case if the element E if omitted, it is assumed mixed, and if also
the index is omitted then <code>[]</code> is assumed. Then a bare
<code>array</code> type is equivalent to <code>array[]mixed</code> that allows
indeces and elements of any type.
</p>

<p>
Several indices may be provided to define a matrix, for example:
<code>float[int][int]</code> is a matrix of floating point numbers. The
rightmost index is the inner index.
</p>

<div class="note_box">
<b>Do not mix int and string keys in arrays</b><br>
PHP allows to mix indices of type <b>int</b> and of type <b>string</b> on
the same array. However there is a quirk: as stated by the PHP manual,
<i>if a key</i> (an index, in our discussion) <i>is the standard
representation of an integer, it will interpreted as such.</i> Isn't
unclear to me what the manual exactly means as "standard representation"
of an integer, but it gives this example: <code>$a[8]</code> and
<code>$a["8"]</code> are the same element, while <code>$a["08"]</code> is
dereferenced actually using the string "08" as an index. In general,
different strings might be evaluated to indices that collide with others
integer numbers.  So, be careful selecting the type of the index that
better matches your needs.
</div>

<p>
If you really need an associative array that maps both strings and integers
to different values, the problem stated in the box above may be resolved
adding a fixed string to the given index. For example, this code maps
the key <code>$key</code> into the value <code>$value</code>:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<code>$map[ "x" . $key ] = $value;</code>
</div>

<p>
This ensures that different values of the <code>$key</code>, that can
be either integer numbers or strings of characters, will be mapped into
distinct elements of the array. Note too that the NULL string (a value
allowed for a <b>string</b> according to the type model of PHPLint) would
be mapped into <code>"x"</code> exactly as the empty string <code>""</code>:
how to resolve this ambiguity is left as an exercise for the reader :-)
</p>




<h3>Building arrays element-by-element</h3>

<p>
PHPLint guesses the structure of a variable examining its usage. The
presence of the operator "<code><b>[</b></code>" lets to guess that the
variable is an array, the type of the expression giving the index gives
the type of the index of the array, and the type of the expression
assigned gives the type of the elements. In this example, the type of
the variables is guessed from their usage:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
$players[] = "Rick"; # Guess: $players is string[int]
$players[] = "John";

$groups['beta'] = $players;  # Guess: $groups is
                             # string[string][int]

$matrix[0][0] = 1.0;  # Guess: $m is float[int][int]
$matrix[0][1] = 0.0;
/* ... */

$params["width"] = 10.0;  # Guess: $parmas is float[string]
$params["height"] = 7.0;
$params["depth"] = 3.0;
</pre></div>







<h3>The array constructor</h3>

<p>
The <code>array()</code> is a special construct of the PHP language
that allows to define an array, its values and their indeces using only
one instruction.  The <code>array()</code> lets to assign both the
elements and the index (or key) of each element. For example, the same
arrays of the example above might be rewritten as:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
$players = array("Rick", "John");
$groups = array( "beta" =&gt; $players );
$matrix = array( array(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
                 array(0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
                 array(0.0, 0.0, 1.0));
$params = array("width" =&gt; 10.0, "height" =&gt; 7.0, "depth" =&gt; 3.0);
</pre></div>


<p>
PHPLint parses the <code>array()</code> constructor to guess the type the
resulting array.  The first element of the array can contain an expression
giving the key and an expression giving the value
</p>

<blockquote>
<code>array( KEY =&gt; VALUE, </code>...
</blockquote>

<p>
This first element gives the structure of the array acconding to these rules:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If the key is not present, the index is <b>int</b>.</li>
<li>If the key is present, its type must be <b>int</b> or <b>string</b>,
and the type of the index is set accordingly.</li>
<li>The type of the element gives the type of the elements of the array,
	and any following element must either match the same type, or be a subclass
	of the first element.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once the first element of the array constructor has been parsed,
PHPLint scans the remaining elements. Each key/element pair found must
match the type of the first pair. If a key does not match, a warning
message is raised and the type of the index can be either <b>int</b>
or <b>string</b>. If an element does not match the type of the first
element an error is reported and the type of the elements of the
array becomes <b>mixed</b>.
</p>

<p>
The empty array <code>array()</code> don't lets PHPLint to guess anything
about the structure of the array, so the resulting type is a generic
<code>array[]</code> with index and element types both unknown.  To build
an empty array of a specific type, you <b>must</b> use a formal type-cast operator
(see chapter <u>Typecasting</u>):
</p>

<div class="code_box"><code>
$file_names = /*. (string[int]) .*/  array();
</code></div>

<p>
The following table summarizes the rules PHPLint applies trying to detect
the structure of the array. $k is an expression giving a value of the type
K (<b>int</b> or <b>string</b>). $e is an expression giving a value of the
type E.
</p>

<pre>

</pre>
<table align=center cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 border=1>

<tr>
<th>Array constructor</th>
<th>Detected type</th>
<th>Note</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>/*.&nbsp;(E[K])&nbsp;.*/&nbsp;array()</code></td>
<td><code>E[K]</code></td>
<td>
The formal typecast is the PHPLint meta-code in the comment that tells to
PHPLint which is the exact expected type of the empty array.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>array()</code></td>
<td><code>mixed[]</code></td>
<td>
The empty array has a special meaning for PHPLint because a formal type-cast
operator <code>/*.(T).*/</code> can be applied to it; the same operator
cannot be applied to non-empty array.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>array($e, ...)</code></td>
<td><code>E[int]</code></td>
<td>
The type of the index is <b>int</b> and the first element will be stored at
the offset 0. The type of the elements is the type of the expression
$e. If more that one element is present, the others elements must be
of the same type of $e or subclass of it, and the keys, if they are present,
must be of type int.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>array($k&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;$e, ...)</code></td>
<td><code>E[K]</code></td>
<td>
The type of the index is the type K of the expression $k. K must be the
type <b>int</b> or the type <b>string</b>. The type of the elements is
the type E of the expression $e. If more that one element is present,
the others elements must be of the same type E or subclass of E, and the keys,
if they are present, must be of the type K; missing keys are allowed only
if the guessed type of the key is <b>int</b>.
</td>
</tr>

<div class="note_box">
<b>Do not mix types in arrays</b><br>
You cannot list elements of different types in the same
array() constructor; all the elements must be assignment-compatible with
the first one.
</div>


For example

<div class="code_box">
<code>array(1, "two")</code>
</div>

<p>
causes a warning message for mixed types and then the array is assumed
<code>mixed[int]</code>. If the first element is an object, then the following
elements must be objects of the same class or subclass, or the NULL value and,
in the general case, the next elements must be assignment-compatible with
the first one.
If you really need to build an array of mixed
elements, first declare the empty array, then add the mixed elements one by
one, like in this example:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>
$a = /*. (mixed[int]) .*/ array();
$a[] = 1;
$a[] = "two";
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Some examples (the comments report the type of the resulting expression):
</p>


<div class="code_box">
<pre>
# Our test class:
class A { }

# The comment shows the assigned type guessed by PHPLint:
$a0 = array();  // mixed[]
$a1 = array( 123, 456, 789 );  // int[int]
$a2 = array( 123, 456, "xyz"); // mixed[int] - ERROR: mixing
                               // elements of different types
$a3 = array( 1=&gt;"one", 2=&gt;"two", 8=&gt;"eight");  // string[int]
$a4 = array( array( new A() ) ); // A[int][int]
$a5 = array( "data" => $a4 ); // A[string][int][int]
$x = $a4[0]; // A[int]
$y = $a4[0][0]; // A

/**
 * Builds a row of objects A.
 * @param int $width Number of elements in the row.
 * @return A[int] Array of exactly $width A objects.
 */
function BuildRow($width)
{
    $row = array( new A() );
    for( $i = 1; $i &lt; $width; $i++ )  $row[$i] = new A();
    return $row;
}

/**
 * Builds a matrix of objects A.
 * @param int $width Width of the matrix (columns).
 * @param int $height Height of the matrix (rows).
 * @return A[int][int] The matrix of $width*$height A
 * objects.
 */
function BuildMatrix($width, $height)
{
    $m = array( BuildRow($width) );
    for( $i = 1; $i &lt; $height; $i++ )  $m[] = BuildRow($width);
    return $m;
}

$matrix = BuildMatrix(4, 4);  // A[int][int]
</pre>
</div>


<p>
Unsure of the actual type of a variable? PHPlint can tell you with this
little trick:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>if( $a5 ) ;</pre>
</div>

Since PHPLint is expecting a boolean expression as argument of the if()
statement, it will complain if the variable $a5 is anything else than a
boolean. In this case the error message will be:

<blockquote><code>
    <b>ERROR: `if(EXPR)': expected expression of the type boolean, but found
    A[string][int][int]. Remember that an array with zero elements evaluates
    to FALSE, and an array with one or more elements evaluates to TRUE.</b>
</code></blockquote>

The error message above contains the response: the variable $a5 has been
detected by PHPLint to be of type A[string][int][int].



<h3>Runtime errors accessing arrays</h3>

<p>
The formal validation of the source does not prevent errors that may be
detected only at runtime by the PHP interpreter. Arrays are particularly prone
to bugs that cannot be detected with a static analysis (or, at least, that
PHPLint cannot detect yet). One of the most common errors of this type is
accessing a missing entry, like in this example:
</p>

<div class="code_box">
<pre>
&lt;?php
error_reporting(-1);

$a = array(1, 2, 3);
var_dump($a[9]);
</pre></div>

<blockquote><pre><b>==&gt; Notice: Undefined offset: 9 in /home/salsi/test.php on line 5
    NULL</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The error here is evident to the human eye: we are accessing an element of the
array that does not exist, PHP recognizes the issue and reports a notice just
because I have set the maximum error level detection (-1), but the program
still continues running possibly generating random results. On a real
program, things becomes rapidly more complicated, and detecting errors like
these becomes really difficult. My suggestions are:
</p>

<ul>
	
<li>
<b>Integer indices must start from zero.</b> Arrays of type <code>T[int]</code>
must have integer indices 0, 1, 2, ...
</li>

<li>
<b>Prevention.</b>
Apply PHPLint for a first, formal validation. Also review the code and try to
make it clean and readable. Use the <code>array_key_exists(key, arr)</code>
function if you are not sure if a certain key exists. Every function and method
should check if its arguments are valid and in the expected range; if not, an
<tt>IllegalAegumentException</tt> or a <tt>RuntimeException</tt> should be
thrown; these exceptions are unchecked under PHPLint, that is they should cause
an immediate abort because are the clear symptom of a bug.
</li>

<li>
<b>Testing.</b>
Every important package or class should have its
own test suite. For example, for every <tt>MyClass.php</tt> there might be a
<tt>test-MyClass.php</tt> that performs a number of tests on every method and
with different input parameters. Run the whole set of test units before the
deployment of a new release.
</li>

<li>
<b>Enable maximum runtime error detection level.</b>
You may either set it in the php.ini once for all:
<blockquote>
<code>error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT | E_STYLE | E_DEPRECATED</code>
</blockquote>
or you may set it at runtime like in the example above. Also remember to send
error message to a log file, typically the error log file of the WEB server,
and do not display errors to the user (display_errors = Off). Always read
carefully the log, every day, and refine you program until the number of
messages be reduced to a minimum.
</li>

<li>
<b>Dead programs are better than zombie programs.</b>
Safety (data integrity, etc.) and security increase if the program gets killed
as soon as possible whenever an unexpected problem is detected. Also the
"notice" we saw above <b>is</b> a potential security and safety risk we must
avoid absolutely. PHPLint provides the <code>errors.php</code> package along
with its library: this package maps errors (E_NOTICEs included) into exceptions
that normally stop the execution and generate a detailed report with stack
trace.
</li>

</ul>
